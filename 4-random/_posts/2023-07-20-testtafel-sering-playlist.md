I made a playlist for my workplace! This playlist is meant to be played during dinner at our restaurant. I spent an unreasonable amount of time on this.

May include: antique references to TestTafel; songs with the names of my colleagues; selected fillers; removed tracks; bluegrass; kitsch French songs from the ’80s; only four songs by Pond; one or two meme tracks (spoiler: one); experimental breakbeat, cat sounds and vocoders; Song 32; a lot of interplay between the tracks as well as references to the part of the dinner service we’re in.

Hope I could whet your appetite :)

I made a playlist for my workplace! I spent an unreasonable amount of time on this.

May include: antique references to de Sering; songs with the names of my colleagues; selected fillers; removed tracks; bluegrass; Song 32; only four songs by Pond; one or two meme tracks (spoiler: one); kitsch French songs from the '80s; experimental breakbeat with cat sounds and vocoders; a lot of interplay between the tracks and many references in song titles and lyrics to which part of the dinner service we're currently in.

Hope I could give you an appetite :)

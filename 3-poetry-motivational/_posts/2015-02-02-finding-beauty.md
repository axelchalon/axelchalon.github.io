Beauty lies in the bond, the sublime, intangible bond between your mind and the world. It lies not within the object, but your perception of it.

A nuisance, an attunement, a melody.

*

Voices and languages. Beauty is communicated through their innate symbiosis. Language is nothing without orality. Read words, speak to your mind. Poetry and prosody.

Soon, darkness will seize us.

In the meantime, let us experience beauty, and want to experience it, for our eyes have to be open for the sun to shine in.

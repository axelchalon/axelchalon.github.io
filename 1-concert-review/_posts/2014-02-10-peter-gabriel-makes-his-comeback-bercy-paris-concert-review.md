*To mark the 25th anniversary of their album "So", the original band members gave a historical concert at Bercy on October 15th in front of a receptive and enthusiastic audience.*

Nine o'clock: the lights go out. Enter two young Swedish women, Jennie Abrahamson on keyboard and Linnea Olson on violin. Playing at moments in solo, at others in duo, they make for a short but effective opening act: we are blown away by the clarity of their voices, notably by Jennie Abrahamson's in "Phoenix". The outstanding quality of the acoustics is pleasantly surprising, and the combination of classical instruments and electronic effects succeeds in gripping them until the very last second of the act.

Having invited new converts to purchase their albums at the end of the concert, the two Swedes now step aside to give way to the main act; they will later return as backing vocalists.

Peter Gabriel proceeds to explain to us in French that he will first give an acoustic performance with the lights still on as entrée; next will come the main course, with electronic pieces; and finally, the dessert, and not just any dessert: to our delight, the entire album "So" will be played, front to back. By the look of things, both gourmets and gourmands will be satisfied!

From the start, we are mesmerized by the staging, as creative and impressive as ever. Some notable moments include the enormous dome going down and eventually consuming the singer in "The Tower That Ate People", the row of masked men facing the anguished audience in "We Do What We're Told", and Peter Gabriel splayed out on stage on the bullseye of a target in "Mercy Street". All this is broadcast on a giant screen by means of cameras maneuvered by several technicians on stage, letting us observe the artist only centimetres away from his face. We are thus treated to some unique staging for each song.

The audience is won over by a rousing "Sledgehammer", "Digging in the dirt", just as powerful, and "Don't Give Up", still poignant despite the absence of Kate Bush. The band plays hit after hit, until they finally reach the climax of the evening with the renowned "In Your Eyes", characteristic of Peter Gabriel's world-music influence as much by its tones as by its choreography. Peter Gabriel and Jennie Abrahamson, accompanied by Mauritanian musician Daby Touré, dance in circles and successively alternate between choruses and vocal improvisation; the result is exhilarating and utterly convincing.

After two hours of music, the concert customarily ends with "Biko", in honour of the South-African anti-apartheid activist who died behind bars. Driven by the band, fists go up and Bercy makes itself heard. The stage empties, with the audience giving an ovation to Biko, on the backdrop. It is a striking final sight, filled with symbolism, in which we recognize the genius of the engaged artist who had taken part in Amnesty's benefit concerts and created the human rights non-profit "Witness".

An ever-so-heartwarming voice, moving melodies, and grandiose staging: Peter Gabriel managed to charm us once more!

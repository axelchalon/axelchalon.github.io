Here are some scraps from my reading of Anthony Bourdain's very entertaining, insightful and impressive memoir Kitchen Confidential — my most fun read this year. ✝

^
- **Impactful moments as a kid — that will shape one's whole life.** (× [core desire line (How to Know a Person)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^core-desire-line)) (Anthony Bourdain's cold soup "wow moment"; AnCo).
- "**Whatever had the most shock value became my meal of choice"** — deliberately going for the experimental (music).
- **"He knew, I think, that I had already been humiliated"** — nothing more to break; being "broken" by somebody as an curricular experience for a chef.
- **Quoting staggering prices**: "the more it cost, the more people wanted it" — "business was suddenly very, very good."
- Ingredients: savoir-faire, partners, drugs, opportunities.
- Dirty toilet, dirty kitchen.
- "**Your body is *not* a temple. It's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.**"
- Pros don't pivot — redouble efforts on original vision, know how much they're willing to lose before pulling the plug.
- **Character trumps skills or employment history.** "Skills can be taught. Character you either have or don't have."
- Bigfoot — paragon of integrity and values.
- Hear the same incident from different sources — notice what each source leaves out (and why.)
- Prepping mentally the day ahead (× [Made to Stick]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-12-10-made-to-stick-chip-dan-heath-summary.md %}#^plan-day-ahead)).
- "during the middle of the rush, the pace was positively relaxing — more a seriously focussed waltz than mosh-pit slam-dancing" — × NO&B show-caller, relaxed voice.
	- Different ways of working — hectic & high-energy or relaxed & focussed.
		- "Wow" moments, of insight that things can be done differently (× rels).
		- Quantity vs quality.
		- × "It doesn't have to be crazy at work."
- If you have blemishes, **own it.** If you steal, have a weakness, or dishonest somewhere — be transparent about it & own it.
- **Always be on time.**
- "Lazy, sloppy and slow are bad. Enterprising, crafty and hyperactive are good" — a work branch's idioms.
- **"Assume the worst. Be *<mark>amused</mark>* by what you see or suspect.** "Just because someone you work with is a miserable, treacherous, self-serving, capricious and **corrupt asshole shouldn't prevent you from enjoying his company, working with him or finding him entertaining.**"
	- "Have a sense of humour about things." (British spelling mine)

- General kitchen tips:
	- Mise en place (× MacOs/Régie pre-show mise — knowing where everything is)
	- A shitload of towels

- Meta (Elements of Book-Writing) (× [Tiny Experiments]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-08-04-tiny-experiments-anne-laure-le-cunff-summary.md %}#^book-writing))
	- **Closing credits:** the characters now — what has become of the people from the book, X years later, at time of publishing.

*Here are my notes on* Essentialism *by Greg McKeown.*
^
- **Make clear decisions and commit**, in order to prevent constantly questioning yourself (decision fatigue). (× [Clear Thinking (rules to prevent decision fatigue)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^rules-to-prevent-decision-fatigue))
	- **Fewer decisions — better made.**
- <a name="^reduce-priorities"></a>**Reduce priorities.** If everything is a priority, nothing is. You cannot have five priorities going on at once. For most of history, 'priority' was used exclusively in the singular.
	- **Focus yields results.** Instead of spreading oneself too thin and making a bit of progress if many directions; concert your efforts and make significant progress in one direction. "The success that results from making a consistent set of choices." **Less but better.**
- "**Shift the ratio of activity to meaning"** (× busy-work) (× [OKRs (output instead of activity)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}#^output-instead-of-activity); [Naval (be paid for your output, not your input)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-07-25-almanack-naval-ravikant-summary.md %}#^paid-for-output-not-input))
- <a name="^most-important-knowing"></a>**If you don't know what's the most important, then the most important is to figure it out.**
^
- <a name="^endowment"></a>**Endowment effect** — we value things we own more than they are worth.
	- **"If I didn't own this, how much would I pay for it?"**, to reduce possessions. ([The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-10-15-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-summary.md %}); [The Laws of Simplicity]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-19-laws-simplicity-john-maeda.md %}) (reducing)). 
	- **"If I wasn't involved in this project, how hard would I work to get on it?"** The endowment effect happens for projects we own as well (clinging to them). Uncommit from non-essential projects you are responsible for.
- **Sunk-cost bias: continuing down the path because you've invested a lot in it already** — even though you should ditch it (e.g. personal projects).
- <a name="^zero-based"></a>**Zero-based budgeting**: at the beginning of a new period, review expense items individually — rather than starting off from last period's budget. (blank slate, clean slate) (prevents inertia effect, status quo bias.)
	- **Zero-based life review:** periodically questioning all of your habits, projects, use of your time and of your energy.
	- **Zero-based scheduling:** **"If I didn't have this commitment, how much would I want it?"** (applied to one's calendar)
		- **Dream Week**: "Start with a blank one-week calendar. Design your Dream Week: what's most important each day."
- **[Reverse pilot](https://www.aerotime.aero/images/Wings-over-Baltics-Airshow-2019.jpg):** remove something suspected unessential, see if there is a (negative) response. If not, congratulations, you've removed something unessential. (to prevent status quo bias)
- **External advice helps with getting untrapped from the endowment effect.**
^
- **You can always choose** — even if you cannot control the options. Deciding is an action. If you don't decide, someone else will do it for you (or your past self will (× [Debt]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-20-debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber-summary.md %}#^tied-to-past))). (× [At the Existentialist Café]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-05-22-at-the-existentialist-cafe-sarah-bakewell-summary.md %}); Frankl) Choices vs options. **"Choose choice, in every area of your life."** (intentionality) (× [Clear Thinking]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}); [Psycho-Cybernetics (tackle your issues)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#^tackle-problems))
^
- **Don't decide on something just because the ideal option isn't there yet.**  Don't choose an option because it's the least bad. Wait out the ideal option ­— decline other options in the meantime. Be comfortable with the void; make space (for the ideal option). (× hiring: the cost of a bad hire is higher than being one staff short)
- **Use explicit and NARROW criteria.** "Would that person LOVE working here? Would we LOVE working with that person?" ("Is this a "fuck yes"?" ­× [Art of Gathering (no invites by obligation)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^no-invites-by-obligation); [Never Split the Difference (enthusiastic acquiescence — "that's right")]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-06-01-never-split-the-difference-summary.md %}#^thats-right))
	- "We might never have gone after it, but now it is so easy to get it that we consider it." (× [endowment effect (prizing possessions more, keeping them "by default", because of ease)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^endowment)) "**If I didn't have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to acquire it?**"
^
- **Having clarity (on your priority) eases saying no.** ("When you have nothing to protect...") We can say no and feel bad for a few minutes; or say yes, feels good for a few minutes, and feel bad for weeks or months.
- **No by default** — instead of yes by default. Reject everything except the essential.
	- "**What are the trade-offs?**" (to accepting this invite, taking on this project) — what am I sacrificing for it? (× [Clear Thinking (what is the cost of choosing this?)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^cost))
		- Remembering the trade-off helps you say "no" more easily.
	- **If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.**
	- **"Their problem is not your problem."**
- **[Graceful no's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) (declining adroitly)**
	- A clear "no" is better than a vague "yes" or a noncommittal response.
	- **"No, but..."** (let's meet up after my exam!) ("you are welcome to ... ; I am willing to ..." — negotiating (a.k.a. "no, but this much I can do for you"))
	- **Defer response: "Let me check my calendar and get back to you"**
	- **E-mail bouncebacks: "I'm in Monk Mode writing my book until the end of the month."**
	- (To a superior) **"Yes, what should I de-prioritize?"**
		- Applied to one's life: if I add this activity, what do I decide to ditch? If I take on this project, what do I decide to de-prioritize?
	- Setting rules (known to everyone) in advance (≠ yes man)
^
- <a name="^too-busy"></a>**Take time off to reflect; re-prioritize.** ≠ Being too busy to question what you're busy with. Schedule "time off", review-time, daydreaming-time.
	- **Review your journaling month and identify trends, patterns.** Find the headline of the period — see the big picture; don't get lost in the details. 
- **Monthly team meeting for brainstorming and agreeing on priorities.** Clear direction. (× [Clear Thinking (agreeing on the problem first)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^problem-solution-firewall))
	- <a name="^single-responsibility"></a>Let each person have a clear responsibility and a single goal / top priority (PayPal) (× [Measure What Matters (accountability)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}#^accountability); [Shop Class as Soulcraft (communal ownership)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-10-23-shop-class-as-soulcraft-summary.md %}#^communal-ownership); [Shop Class as Soulcraft (anarchy is irresponsibility)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-10-23-shop-class-as-soulcraft-summary.md %}#^anarchy-is-irresponsibility); [Naval (reputation)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-07-25-almanack-naval-ravikant-summary.md %}#^reputation); [The Design of Everyday Things (less ownership means less vigilance)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^less-ownership-less-vigilance); [The Toyota Way (single-point accountability)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^single-point-accountability)). Check in often ([gemba]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^gemba)); help remove roadblocks to the people. "What obstacles or bottlenecks are holding you back from achieving X, and how can I help remove these?"
- **Express what you're trying to achieve and what's important for you in the project** when teaming up to work together. Agree on the direction before starting.

Here are a couple of things that really matter to me..."

- **Remove constraints first** — systematic things that hamper your progress. First remove blocks & brakes; then double in on accelerators (× [Come As You Are]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-03-emily-nagoski-come-as-you-are-summary.md %}#^accelerating-with-brakes-on), [Sex Talks]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^reduce-turn-offs-first): first reduce turn-offs, then double in on turn-ons) (× [The Toyota Way (work clean, then work fast)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^work-clean-then-work-fast); [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}) (reducing waste, then improving processes by bursts (kaizen); [The Toyota Way (highlight the problem through continuous flow))]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^highlight-the-problem) & [Psychedelics Revealing (amplify issues to have to confront them)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^amplify-to-confront))
	- "What is the "slowest hiker" in your job or your life? What is the obstacle that is keeping you back from achieving what really matters to you?" (80/20)
	- **"Making a one-time investment in removing obstacles (early)"** (group retreats, therapy, etc.)
^
- **Prepare early.** Pack a few days ahead; make buffers. (× [Clear Thinking (2x margin of safety)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^margin-of-safety))
	- "**What is the minimal amount I could do *right now* to prepare?** (for an upcoming goal or deadline).

	- **Play lets us come up with new stories.**
	- You cannot be playful and tense at the same time.
^
- **Knowing the boundaries frees you to play in all of the space.** Schoolchildren only playing in a small area because of a nearby road — a fence is put up — they now play in the whole area and know they're safe there. **By knowing the boundaries, we can live closer to the edges, and bigger.** Test the boundaries.
^
- <a name="^protect-asset"></a>**Protect the asset.** You are the tool for making your highest contribution to the world. Invest in yourself.

- Control the behaviour of your children by creating an economy (weekly token allowance, to be traded either for money or screen time; × [Debt (creating an economy)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-20-debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber-summary.md %}#^creating-an-economy))

	- **To change a routine, change the cue.** Don't focus on the behaviour but focus on the cue.

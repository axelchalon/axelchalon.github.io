_Those are my personal notes on Rebecca Solnit's book "A Paradise Built in Hell" about communities arising in disasters._

* Generally, the people furthest away from the disaster tend to panic the most, be the most emotionally affected, and have the most distorted view of its actualities.
	* People directly affected by the disasters most often look back positively on them and their local response.
	* People at its epicentre (ideally, typically) live through the disaster collectively, as a bonding experience, **creating community**.
		* **Collective suffering redeems.** (Isolated suffering is the true bane.)
		* Disasters unite (through the common fighting against an exogenous adversary)
	* At the heart of the disaster, there is often very little doubt on the right, natural, instinctual thing to do. "There is no time for fear."
		* Disasters, disaster utopias let society operate alternatively, focussed on immediateness and generosity rather than transactions, calculation and profit.
			* "No long-term plans, just the immediate demands of survival."
			* Through the suspension of the usual order, disasters liberate and let one act in new ways.
				* *communitas* (Victor Turner): the spontaneous ties that are made beyond constructs, societal boundaries and limiting beliefs.
			* Disasters ["provide a view into another world for our other selves"]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %})
			* Disasters wake people up. Ruptures in daily life bring with them an immersion in the present, clarity of thought and a sense of urgency.
				* These states do not necessarily have to be brought about by disasters.
				* One should find other means to "manually" engineer or trigger these states.
					* "One of the complex questions for those who need not struggle for basic survival is how to engage passionately with goals and needs that keep such drive alive."
		     	* Disaster-created utopias typically do not persist, though they could, and should.
				* Reflecting on the experience helps seize it and re-create it.
					* **Language is essential in helping to seize, make sense of an experience and create a mental framework.**
				* Making such projects endure is a challenge (× [All About Love]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %})).
				* Temporary autonomous zones (TAZ) (just like burns) are an attempt at re-creating these circumstances temporarily (though recurrently), with the added benefit of ephemerality an effective tactic to forestall repression.
					* "TAZ liberate an area of land, of time, of imagination."
			* These utopias, where neighbours meet, remind citizens of fundamentals lost in modern society.
	* Disasters bring back civic life: engagement with one's community.
		* In our modern world, we rarely feel connected to society, only in rare occurrences — the experience of citizenship is getting rarer and rarer.
		* Disasters provoke a universal enlistment in community.
		* The emergency circumstances infuse people with meaning (just like war): "The martial type of character can be bred without war. The only thing needed henceforward is to inflame the civic temper as past history has inflamed the military temper." (James)
* The first response in any disaster is by the common people, not the state, emergency services, or charities.
	* We tend to think otherwise due to the fact that when the press arrive on the site of the disaster, emergency services are already here — but already a lot of time has elapsed since the outbreak.
	* Residents are "here" when the disaster happens and their response "make it or break it", dictate whether the disaster becomes controlled or a catastrophe.
* Top-down, one-way "charity" differs from mutual aid; one creates a dependence and a power dynamic, the other fosters community and self-sufficiency ("learning how to fish").
	* A happy medium is to support (already existing) local efforts.
* Self-organisation in disasters reveals the superfluity of governing institutions.
	* Self-organisation demonstrates that a state is not necessary for society to function and adhere to principles and morals (anarchy — a state of society without government or law)
	* This insight endangers the legitimacy, authority and existence of the powers that be.
		* Chaos (such as that provoked by disasters) shakes things up, reorganizes things, and renders the established order particularly fragile and malleable.
			* "An emergency is a separation from the familiar."
		* Crises (for instance provoked by disasters) mark a turning point, "in which things can go either of two ways", with the potential to subvert entrenched institutions and patterns of thinking. (Disasters "wake people up".)
	* The state and the media tend to assume that a society struck by disaster, in a temporary state of lawlessness, naturally degenerates into a mob of profiteers, looters and criminals
		* In reality people have other concerns, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, a better nature.
		* What actually emerges is a culture of mutual aid and natural attendance to each other's needs.
	* Disasters can suggest the inadequacy of governing authorities, once again jeopardizing their legitimacy.
		* Bureaucracy is good at dealing with predictable systems, terrible at dealing with emergency situations that require improvising and thinking outside the box.  ([× Toyota Way: having a mix of organic and mechanistic attributes]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#orga-mecha-mix))
		* Because of this, bureaucracy is often incompetent in dealing with disasters and often gets in the way of emergency relief initiatives.
	* Because of these perceived threats, disasters often trigger an unwarranted impulse to control on the part of the ruling powers, sometimes excessive: "elite panic".
		* It is often the few at the top who behave badly and the masses who shine, the opposite of what sensationalistic narratives want us to believe.
			* The state typically wants to spin the story such that they are portrayed as the saviours of the people.
		* These delusional beliefs and decisions are typically held and made based on rumours and biases and without actually seeing the situation first-hand at the disaster site.
			* **See things for yourself and form your own opinion.** (× [Toyota Way: gemba]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#gemba))
			* "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." (Roosevelt)
		* This reaction from the authorities can stifle already existing, well-functioning grassroots response initiatives or even clash with them.
* **Beliefs matter**.
	* Beliefs shape how you act, and, especially in times of crisis, how you act (and how your fellows act) becomes a matter of life and death, determine whether you live or die.
	* Work on, revise and decide on beliefs now, while you have time to think, before it is too late and the circumstances become critical.
* **Beliefs make the world.**
	* **The world is created by beliefs, by acts out of beliefs.**
		* Reality and states of mind form a loop: circumstances create states of mind, which in turn create circumstances. (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}))
		* Policy changes are fundamentally contingent on changing societal beliefs; the policy changes then naturally ensue.
	* **"Any belief that is acted on makes the world in its image."** (self-fulfilling prophecies) (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}))
	* A belief doesn't have any truth by itself (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %})); its value can be judged on the basis of the consequences it would have on the world (pragmatism: "what difference would it make?")
		* Pragmatism focusses on what to make of the world, rather than what it is made of; is prescriptive rather than descriptive. (× the action focus of [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}); [not having to psycho-analyse yourself]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#psychoanalyse))
	* **"Revolutions fail, but never fail to do something."**
		 * Striving towards something impossible is still meaningful.
			* The belief that social change and utopia is possible lets people act in ways that shape the world for the better — sometimes even making the original vision a reality.
			* Initiatives, disasters and other events imperceptibly set things in motion with snowballing effects down the line, for example through a transformed individual.
		 * Meaning is in working towards the paradise, not being in it.

* Celebrations (anniversaries) are about reconnecting to the sense of possibility and exhilaration that were felt during the original event, landmark or encounter — reconnecting to what potential and possibilities they hold and what they symbolize; reconnecting to the high hopes and visions for the future they carry with them; it is an instance of realignment, an unmuddling of the mind and a regular reset to start off from the right place again. "Letting ties again become enchantments rather than obligations." Celebrations let you reconnect to the sense of possibility, magic of a connection.
	* "When the connections were made, the possibilities were exciting, and joy came readily afterward. Memory of such moments becomes a resource to tap into through recollecting and invocation, and celebrating those moments revives and reaffirms the emotions. [...] **The enchanted time can be reclaimed and renewed by memory and celebration.**"
	* Celebrations as falling in love again, as reviving these feelings, and reconnecting to the exciting possibilities. (× ["Sex Talks"]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}))
* Carnivals (just like role-playing) are a "temporary liberation from the prevailing truth".
	* Carnivals historically happened outside of time: "Some ancient calendars had three hundred sixty days, the five at the end of the year were categorically outside time, so that the ordinary rules did not apply."
	* Carnivals (just like psychotropics) let you return to ordinary life with a newfound sense of possibility, not accepting the current reality as it is but understanding that things can be different.
* "Community projects: "working with, rather than for".
	* "Sweat equity" (New Orleans): the future homeowners must work on the houses.
* "After that I had twenty dollars, Sharon put up thirty dollars, and with that we financed Common Ground."
* Dorothy Day: not making a distinction between falling in love with things and people.
* **"It is when people deviate from the script that exciting things happen."**

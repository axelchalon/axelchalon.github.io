^
My takeaways from Michael Chekhov's "To the Actor: On the Technique of Acting".
^
What a book.
^
- **Art is interpretation,** not copy. (× [Creative Being]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}))
	- Artists re-present impressions of the typically unseen or overlooked (e.g. Willy the Salesman: while the audience encounters salesmen like him all the time.) (Artists "bring attention to" — × [Psychedelics Revealing (attention)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^attention))
	* The artist's mission is to convey what he sees and feels.
^
- **With every artist their dominant theme**, underlying all of their work.
	- e.g. Good and Evil (Schiller); mysticism in everyday moments (Maeterlinek); universal archetypes (Goethe); search for god (Dostoyevsky (Karamazov))
	- What would the recurring theme in your work be?
^
* **Develop your psychology and sensibility.**
	* **Empathize with characters and people from different eras**. 
	* **See other people as different, not just "as yourself".** Only then can you study them with curiosity.
	* **Strive to understand people based on their personality and circumstances**; based on their objectives. "Ask yourself *why* they feel the way they do (or act the way they do)."
		- **See people as a frame in the story (legend) of their life.** (× [The Hero With a Thousand Faces]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-02-joseph-campbell-hero-thousand-faces-summary.md %})). How they've come to be who they are now; their dreams; and the super-objective of their life — realizing one's legend.
	* **Actors are empathetic by trade.** Learning to understand characters is learning to understand humans.
^
* <a name="^bad-environment-active-force"></a>**A bad environment is an active force** — ­e.g. uncreative, inartistic environments.
	* A lack of a quality (in one's environment) is an active force.
- Counteract bad environments by infusing positive stimuli — e.g. texting on a boring car ride: create your bubble.
^
# Acting
- <a name="^improvise-around-necessities"></a>**Frame acting as first and foremost improvising** (around definite scene constraints — e.g. improvising first between a beginning and an end, and eventually in-between all the written moments of the play). Acting is improvising your way from one "required" moment to the next "required moment" ("the necessities").
^
- <a name="^joy-ephemerality"></a>**The joy is in the ephemerality.** If it was forever, it wouldn't be fun. The draw of acting and performing is that they are temporary parts.
	- If we played our characters the whole time, we wouldn't enjoy them.
	- If we acted out our same kinks the whole time, there wouldn't be room for other explorations or balance.
	- If we lived forever, life would lose its value.
	- Pop-up rules in gatherings are accepted and exciting because they are temporary ([The Art of Gathering: Pop-up rules]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^pop-up-rules))
- **Temporality helps objectify.** Because they are time-bound, it is easier to consider parts (e.g. social experiments) objectively and distinguish them from one's self (× [The Art of Gathering]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}): clear beginning and clear end).
	- Who is the actor of your life? By not merging, you let yourself play different parts. (× [Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}); [Psychedelics Revealing]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^real-self)). Don't become the character.
- Plays are a mise-en-abyme. [Life in life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhhL2uKh3O0)
^
- We comprise three selves: our "lower" everyday self, our "higher" creative individuality, and the character.
- **Our higher self does not know self-criticism, lack of confidence, shyness** — these are feelings of our lower self.
- **Our lower self should be a servant to our higher self.** providing body, emotions, voice.
- **Our higher self is always there and accessible** ([Psychedelics Revealing: alternative states of consciousness are parallel, not created]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^parallel-not-created)), **makes its own parallel experience of life** ("it goes on evolving its own, higher kind of experiences") / Our creative self has its own stage time ([Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}#^stage-time)).
- **The higher self is the primary force, to be restrained.** The higher creative self is wild and unrestrained; the purpose of the everyday self is to accommodate it to reality.
^
* <a name="^pg"></a>**Psychological gesture:** a physical stance symbolizing the psychology of a character.
	- **The body as instrument of symbolism:**
		- "Do a new alteration. This time bend your right knee slightly, transferring the weight of your body to the left leg. The PG might now acquire a nuance of *surrender*. Lift your hands up to your chin and the quality of surrender can become stronger and new slight nuances of *unavoidability* and *loneliness* will introduce themselves. Throw your head back and close your eyes: *pain* and *pleading* qualities may appear. Turn your palms outward: *self-defense*. Incline your head to one side: *self-pity*. Bend the three middle fingers of each hand: a slight hint of *humor* might occur. With each alteration speak the same sentence to conform with it, e.g. "I wish to be left alone"." (Same desire, different feelings).
- **Psychological gestures help state-shift.** "Gestures for modifying your psychology."
	- Visualizing a psychological gestures is as effective as performing it. (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}); × [Psychedelics Revealing]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^attention-to-a-medium))
	- PGs provide a pathway to a bundle of will, feelings and desires (like memories — × [Psychedelics Revealing: Memories]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^memories)).
- **Act boldly, even for weak emotions.** Actors should have high energy even when portraying a low-energy character. Psychological gestures should always be made clearly and strongly, even when portraying weak psychologies. (×  [Improvise (assertiveness; bold and clear decisions)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^bold-clear-decisions); [Your Symphony of Selves (more decisions, clearly made)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}); [Never Split the Difference (accusation audit: exaggerating reproaches)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-06-01-never-split-the-difference-summary.md %}#^accusation-audit); [Psychedelics Revealing (high-energy behaving)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^unspecific-amplifiers); Embodied Intimacy's Primal Play (exaggerating feelings); owning feelings)
- **Vacuous vs inhabited gestures**: everyday gestures vs archetypal or embodied gestures. (× <a href="#^pour-presence-onto-touch">pouring your presence onto the objects you touch</a>)
^
# Objectives
* **Each character has their small objectives.**
* **These objectives all serve the character's superobjective.**
	* All small objectives first appear random.
		* <a name="^isolated"></a>"The thing isolated becomes incomprehensible." (Steiner)
	* With knowledge of the superobjective, they become coherent.
- **An objective is a will — doesn't involve emotions or feelings.**
	* e.g. "I wish to ...; I desire to ...; I want to ..."
	* You do not control your feelings and emotions — you either have them, or you don't.
* **Find out people's objectives and superobjective.**
	* Question them to understand them. "What does that person *want*?" — e.g. a guest at a community café.
	* Imagining someone's behaviour upon reaching their goal helps precisely define their superobjective.
* **Objectives can be defined by marking moments**: "And when I saw that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want." (Death of a Salesman)
- **Use your superobjective as compass for life decisions, big and small.** "Does this serve my superobjective?"
- **The characters' superobjectives all serve the play's superobjective** — what "wants to happen".
	- e.g. Love inspiring the creation of the world.
	- What is the superobjective of a place? (e.g. Zart)
- **The actual superobjective of a play is perceived by the audience, not the author.**
- The different characters' objectives and superobjectives as well as the play's superobjective engage with one another in a beautiful dance.
^
# Characterization
- **Imaginary body:** the physical body of the character being played, as an imaginary extra garment that you put on and with which you act.
- **Imaginary center**
	- Where in the body is your center located? Head, heart, genitals, ...?
	- How does it look? Is it small, big? Smooth, spikey, playful? Soft, hard? Cold, warm?
	- e.g. a warm large sphere in your heart area; a radiating ball in front of your third eye; ...
	- **Your imaginary center influences all of your actions** — your personality, your body.
		- Reposition your center to change your behaviour.
- **Inner vs outer tempo**
	- **Inner tempo:** the pace of your thoughts, feelings and emotions; your inner excitement.
	- **Outer tempo:** the pace of your actions.
	- e.g.
		- The grounded but rapid porter: fast outer tempo + slow inner tempo
		* The traveller containing their excitement: fast inner tempo + slow outer tempo
	* **Different tempi for different people** — as well as variations in tempo within one's life. "Everybody goes through life in different tempos. It depends mainly on the temperament and the destiny of a person."
* **Will, feelings, or thoughts.** Multiple characters can stand for the same thing, but with a different primary trait.
* **Idiomatic quirks** ("characterizations"): turns of phrases, nervous gestures — the finishing touch.
* <a name="^same-thing-differently"></a>Different people will do the same thing differently, because of their different PGs.
	* Celebrate uniqueness! (× Bliss Club: "We've each got our own quirks"; × [Come As You Are (metaphor of the garden)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-03-emily-nagoski-come-as-you-are-summary.md %}#^garden); × [Creative Being (each person a unique channel to a higher wisdom)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^unique-channel); [Creative Being (people and art as so many unique fruits from trees)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^unique-fruits); × [Improvise (superstrengths)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^superstrengths); × [Almanack of Naval Ravikant (specific knowledge, coming from your uniqueness)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-07-25-almanack-naval-ravikant-summary.md %}#^uniqueness); × [A Splendid Exchange (develop your environmental advantage, like the camel)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-03-29-a-splendid-exchange-personal-notes.md %}#^camel-environmental-advantage); [Psycho-Cybernetics (develop your own unique personality and accomplishments)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#^unique-accomplishments))
- **"It is always you *plus* somebody else."**
	- You are always "you + a bit of the other person" when interacting with someone.
	- You speak, move, think differently depending on who you are with.
	- Your PG differs slightly based on who you are with. (× [Your Symphony of Selves: one of your selves interacting with one of the other's selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}#^self-to-self)).
	
# Storyline
- Each play is fundamentally about the fight between Good and Evil — and with either Good or Evil winning the game.
^
- **Each play is composed of three units: beginning, transformation, ending.** (Triplicity.)
- **Each of these units contains a climax that summarizes what the unit is about.**
	- Each climax can be seen as a rite of passage, e.g. crossing the threshold, slaying the monster, etc. ([The Hero With a Thousand Faces]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-02-joseph-campbell-hero-thousand-faces-summary.md %}))
	- The climax synthesizes the unit, as a <a href="#^pg">psychological gesture</a> synthesizes a character.
	- Climaxes are where to start with rehearsals — capture the gist of the play.
	- Climaxes are where to start with writing the play — start with the strongest moments. 
- Each of these units marks a new stage in the evolution of Good and of Evil.
* Every main character is waging a fight in the play, and either wins or loses the battle at the end.
- **Contrasting ending**: Plays should start one way and end the opposite way — in atmosphere, tempo, and the rest. (Polarity.)
^
* <a name="^repetition"></a>**Two dimensions of repetition:**
	* **Repetition in space**, e.g. equally distributed rows of windows, pillars, tiers; or human figures passing evenly across the stage
	* **Repetition in time**, e.g. encounters between the two same characters in different scenes
- **Two kinds of repetition:**
	- **Repetition with change**
		* Parallelism: e.g. juxtaposed relationships or characters – exacerbating differences.
		* Repeat – Repeat – Break
	- **Repetitions without change: in time ⇒ eternity; in space ⇒ endlessness.**
* Applicable to set design, sound design, composition.
^
- **Inner vs outer action:**
	- **Inner action:** pauses, silences — though never empty or devoid of purpose. "Empty pauses do not, and should not, exist on the stage. Every pause must have a purpose."
	- **Outer action:** anything visible
- **Rhythmical waves give life to a play.** They make the performance pulsatingly beautiful, kill its monotony.
	- e.g. subdued vs loud moments.
	
# Atmosphere
- **With atmosphere, the audience grasps the piece emotionally**, not just intellectually.
	- Elements contributing to atmosphere: "lights with their shadows and colors; settings with their shapes and forms of compositions; musical and sound effects; grouping of actors, their voices with a variety of timbres, their movements, pauses, changes of tempo, all kinds of rhythmical effects and manner of acting."
- <a name="^atmosphere-glues"></a>**Atmosphere glues.** The atmosphere unites the actors as well as the actors with the audience (× [A Paradise Built In Hell]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-12-24-a-paradise-built-in-hell-summary.md %}))
- **Atmospheres direct actions**. "The atmosphere *urges* you to act in harmony with it." (e.g. Zart) (× <a href="#^bad-environment-active-force">a bad environment is an active force</a>) (× [The Art of Gathering]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}): designing the space) (× [Nudge]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-03-30-nudge-summary.md %})) (× [A Paradise Built In Hell]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-12-24-a-paradise-built-in-hell-summary.md %})) (× [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-10-15-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-summary.md %})) (× [Improvise (culture of safety; permission slip)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^culture)) (× [The Toyota Way (culture)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %})) 
^
# Types of plays
- **Comedy:**
	- Predominant personality trait; taking up a lot of space; quick tempo (with intermittent pauses or slower moments)
- **Drama**:
	- Bad fate, being oneself but not learning lessons or seeing the greater meaning behind things.
	- Drama is tragedy without the Presence. 
- **Tragedy:**
	- Bad fate, dealing with forces greater than oneself and being at their mercy — being aware of it.
	- Suffering + Presence (of a powerful force) — without the latter, it's just drama.
* **Clown**:
	* Lots of small creatures taking turn controlling us. Gay, humorous and silly.
	* Subhuman beings — as opposed to tragedy's superhuman presence.
	* Unexpected, unjustified reactions. A caricature of life, to an extent.
^
# Defies pigeonholing
- "**Tangible intangibles**: certain elements are intangible (e.g. atmosphere) though very clearly present.
	- **Cultural and artistic progress stems from intangibles.** "To progress culturally, life, and especially the arts, must be permeated with all kinds of intangible powers and qualities."
	- What will remain is the intangible.
^
- <a name="^objective-method"></a>"**Objective method**": having a method helps with consistently providing results.
	- "Following the recipe": By simply "following the recipe", you already deliver a good performance. Inspiration can come on top.
		- (e.g. as a technician: doing one's work well, and then the personality comes on top)
	- A great performance is the best way to bring back an elusive inspiration: **"A part correctly played has the best chance of luring back an elusive inspiration."** (Nikolayvsky)
		- (e.g. being on top of things in one's everyday.)
	- Objective assessment (e.g. of plays) through shared framework and vocabulary.
^
- **Body warm-up:**
	- Warm up with slow, clear, deliberate movements. Use the space.
	- Move from the chest.
	* Impulses precede movements; radiation succeeds them.
	- <a name="^pour-presence-onto-touch"></a>**Pour your presence onto the objects you touch.**
	- Your joints are not for stiffness but for freedom of movement.

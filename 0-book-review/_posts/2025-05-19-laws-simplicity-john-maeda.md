In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda (of Depeche Mode remixing fame) lays out principles and weird acronyms for making our life easier. Favourite quote: "At the end of the day, there is an end of the day." (See also: [OKR]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}), [The Design of Everyday Things]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}))

- **To simplify, either reduce, or hide.**
	- Reduce: (× [Creative Act]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^remove-to-perfection))
		- **Reduce features.** (iPod)
		- Reduce size. **Small but mighty.** Make things small (or light) to let them exceed expectations. We don't expect much from small things. Counterbalance smallness (fragility) with projected quality.
		- **Reduce time**: efficient things are seen as simple.
			- **Make the wait shorter** vs **make the wait more tolerable** (the quantitatively fast vs the qualitatively fast).
		- **Organize in order to reduce.** Groupings turn many into few.
			* **Fewer groups.** Group together similar things, then group together similar groups ("slip"). 
				* Create a high-priority list (group) across groups.
	- Hide complexity:
		- **Advanced mode.** Hide non-essential features (if you decide to keep them).
		- **Simplify by abstracting (hiding)**: e.g. cloud syncing services.
		- **Put it far away.** Make it "bottom-of-mind". More appears like less by simply moving it far, far away.
- **Counterbalance simplicity with quality** — either embedded (material) or projected (marketing), i.e. either implicit or explicit.
	- **Advertise what cannot be conveyed implicitly.** (Also for oneself! — [Pavlina (Broadcast Your Desires)](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/02/broadcast-your-desires/); [Improvise (add value, contribute information to the conversation)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^add-value))

- **Knowledge makes things simpler.** (× Scott Young, [No Hard Subjects](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2016/04/12/no-hard-subjects/))
	- **Metaphors as pedagogical "presets"** for learning a tool — as learning shortcuts for complex designs (× [Design of Everyday Things (conceptual model)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^conceptual-models).
- **It's less hard when you have to.** Difficult tasks are easier when they are "need-to-know" rather than "nice-to-know".
^
- **A clear environment highlights things** (e.g. own room; dance studio). A clean space enables the foreground to stand out from the background. (× [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-10-15-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-summary.md %}))
- **Simplicity stands out amidst complexity.** Juxtapose simplicity with complexity to let it stand out.
- People don't just buy **but love** beautiful designs — possessions that make their lives simpler.
- **How our possessions feel changes how we feel.** ("the upside of materialism" — × [Pavlina](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2014/03/prime-your-brain-for-a-permanent-performance-gain-in-a-few-minutes/))

- **Coherence yields simplicity** (repetition of a same message).

- "Much is said about the development from child to adult as a gradual process of neutering emotional output."
- "In the parlance of the business world, professing your love for someone is a high risk, high reward opportunity. As a person happily engaged in a relationship that has lasted for more than fifteen years now, I'm glad to have taken the risk."
- Japan's animistic penchant: every thing is alive, deserves respect.

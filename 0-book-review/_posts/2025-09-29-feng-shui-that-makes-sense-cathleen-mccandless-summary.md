- Bad Feng Shui will have you starring in a horror movie.
- Put plants in every corner of the room (8 total).

- **Nurture your environment.**
	- **When you reduce the stressors in your environment, you reduce the stress in your life.**
^
- Principles of Mr. Feng
	- **Protect your back.**
		- Seats with backrests — not too high as to be oppressive.
		- Beds with headboards and bardheads.
		- House backed by a hill (else, fence, trees.)
	- **Protect your sides.**
		- Seats with armrests
	- **Watch the entrance** (⌘ + POS)
		- Clear view to the main door (e.g. sitting at the desk). Bonus point if your desk blocks the door.
		- Bed with a view to the door but not in line with it. No bed under windows.
		- Mirror if not possible.
		- Have your house be slightly elevated — to be able to look over your neighbourhood. Jack up the house foundations as needed.
	- **No sharp objects.** Except knives.
		- Pointy things are dangerous and we have an aversion to them. (This is why we like wheels — and why pointing at someone is impolite.)
			- Our survival instincts kick in because we might get hurt.
		- Sharp corners are a no-no.
		- Naked room corners are a no-no.
			- **Add curves.** (Great life advice in general) Plants, furniture, the list goes on.
				- **Floral & non-geometric patterns.** Irregularly shaped stone flooring.
			- **Place sharp-edged furniture diagonally in the corners.** (Not only your subs) Makes their corners less prominent.
		- **Soften the edges.** Drape the window frames. [Make them magic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xN4YjljrsM) (Helps separating outside from outside — warms up the cold window.) Flowers along the walkway.
		- [Thorns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQuC32gH8Rw) on mute. Thorny plants are a no-no. [No spikey things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBk0VPFn0pQ).
		- **No straight pathways.** Meandering pathways — as in nature ([river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUA41EdAPlk), [forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdtLyflhGYw) paths).
		- If your house is at the end of a T-junction or dead end, move your house. If you cannot, plant trees to the front.
- Principles of Mr. Shui
	- **Graft nature.** Actual nature® or facsimile.
		- Plants (or silk plants), worms (or silk worms), artwork of nature — for want of windows.
		- **Materials from nature** — wood, stone, june, hemp, bamboo, cotton. Smoke weed, do shibari and brush your teeth.
			- Woven baskets & trunks.
		- Emphasize windows with a view to a forest, a garden or trees. Get your morning wood.
			- Add wood décor. Change your desktop wallpaper.
		- **Watersports.** Add water everywhere, talk to your landlord after. Add a river to your backyard.
		- **Mimic randomness.** Shrubs at irregular intervals, based on a PRNG.
	- **[Balance everything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP9Z5Pc8cRM)** Feng Shui like a breeze — not stuffy, not windy, just the right amount®. (× Aristotle's golden middle) Flowing water, not stagnant water. **Flowing life, not stagnant life.** Just flow.
		* **Retaining balance is a dynamic, active process.** Constantly overshooting and correcting (as in acrobatics) — not just "being in the middle and sitting there".
		* **Yin&yang: each needs their opposite to exist.** 
			* **Seasons as different balances of yin vs yang.** Summer (solstice — prevailing yang), autumn (equinox — balance), winter (solstice — yin), spring (equinox — balance)
			* "Endlessly flowing into one another." Like oat milk in an espresso shot.
		* **Balance your home.** Home in on balance.
			* Home too dark? Add light (in all forms — sunlight, artificial light, mirrors, bright fabrics, light-colored paintings, furniture, flooring)
			* Areas of shade & areas of light.
			* Hard & soft materials.
			* Vary the topography.
* Practical Principles of the Feng
	* [Start outside.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daXKU-tCR8o) Work on your front door first. (× Take care of your appearance, of your looks, first.) Mind your doormat. Flowerpots on each side of your doorway.
		* The front door should be clearly visible and obvious. Label it if not. Make it easy for guests to find your home, and entrance — [give precise instructions otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv8_EZrNhpY). Prefer an easy way over the fastest way. A dead guest is not a returning guest.
		* **Impeccable front door.** Finger-licking good.
	* **Distract with beauty.** Plants at a distance from your electric distribution box.
	- **Have your [space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNbPg6zKmPI).** Do not be forced to interact with people, to be able to enjoy interacting with people. (a.k.a. don't work in the service industry) [Protect your privacy.](https://kagi.com/) "When animals' territories are encroached upon, they become aggressive." — same for [humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NQcrY0FGIg). (And when animals feel safe, they play — Embodied Intimacy)
		- **Close quarters require clear boundaries.** [The closer you are to someone, the more you should retain your sense of identity](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CDRP5ZGFL._SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg). Strong physical boundaries when forced to live close-by.
			- The corollary: big properties don't need hard boundaries.
		- **Decorative screens to split the space.** (Just like area rugs.)
	- **Involve all five senses.** (commonsense, nonsense, sense of humour, incense and sensuality)
		- **Fragrant flowers** near the front door. Sprays. Essential oil diffusers. Scented candles. Deodorant.
			- Peppermint & citrus are the more universally liked scents. "Citrus cleans the space, peppermint clears the mind.
		- **Feelable entities.** River rock, pebbles, textured surfaces, "sensual foliage".
		- "Ugly, bad. Pretty, good." Find the unsightly in your home. Frame it.
		- **Add sound.** Portable speakers, wind chime, "gently babbling fountain", crying toddler. Counterbalance noisy environments with controlled soft background noise. (Fight fire with fire) 
	- **Add life.** Trees, birds, semen.
		- Attract animal life — bird feeders, fountains, crop circles.
		- Add movement — wind chimes, fountains, weather vanes. Dance.
		- Open the windows.
	- **Declutter.**
		- **Out of sight is *not* out of mind.**
			- Keep the trash out of sight, though.
		- Clutter is postponed decision-making.
	- **[Mind your light.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGhtbLuMHY)**
		- Natural light is better for morale. Full-spectrum artificial light comes next. Bright kitchens & yang spaces.
		- Apply your make-up with natural light.
	- **[Any color you like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pEjmZVx3k)** (US spelling) Look in your closet for inspiration — to know which colors you wear and like most.
		- **Neutral colors yield the least fatigue.** Colors found in nature are the least tiring (soft browns, greens, blues).
		- **Use colors to balance.** Warm colors in cold bathrooms. Warm colors around skylight.
		- **Color samples** — bring a swatch, or a piece of the furniture you're considering buying. Have your room's color palette at hand — to juxtapose with potential purchases.
		- **Light colors make a space bigger.** Artwork with depth as well (just on one side, not on both — or it will make the space narrower.) (× [room sizes]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-09-29-feng-shui-that-makes-sense-cathleen-mccandless-summary.md %}#^room-sizes))
		- **No blue in the kitchen** — unappetizing, no food is blue (and certainly not blueberries). Red stimulates the appetite (among other things). Orange as well.
		- **Add accènts** — red (appetizing) accents to a black&white kitchen. Balance black & white with earth tones to warm up.
	- **Artwork and furniture in proportion.** Small artwork for small walls.
		- One large piece is better than several small pieces.
		- **Artwork can be used as a visual reminder of the goals you wish to accomplish.** artwork that promotes thought & creativity (fairies, angels, outer space). Inspiration for each area of your life.
	- **~~Enlarge your~~ Enlarge your room**: mirrors, artwork with depth. Mirrors reflecting windows add more windows. Mirrors in dark places (under the kitchen hood).
	- **Dead people**
		- Have an altar for them, rather than having mementos all over the house. (Likewise for family pictures ­— family altar, "a place for items that have special meaning for each family member")
- Mr Feng buys a house
	- Visit thrice — morning, midday, late afternoon — to have an accurate idea of how much sunlight & noise the house gets.
- Mr Shui leads the ui
	- **Entryway as transition space** (for the nervous system — needs to be safe). Protected on both sides. Area rug to define the space (if no entryway strictly speaking).
	- No windows in doors (fanlights the better option).
	- No mirrors in front of the entrance or at the end of a hallway — feels like somebody is walking towards you. (Prefer artwork under glass.)
	- "Bowling Alley Effect": when you can see through the back of the house as you enter. Reduces awareness of the house itself — attention is drawn to the back.
	- No hanging Damocles swords.
- Room design
	- Public rooms at the front of the house (more easily accessible) (yang — needs more sunlight); private rooms at the back, upstairs (more protected) (yin — needs quiet).
	- Drawing the attention up (or down) the stairs: artwork, differing color. No artwork on the stairs — dangerously distracting. Cascades of pictures accentuate the slant of the [staircase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTLxkMmY4M).
	- <a name="^room-sizes"></a>**Different ceiling heights for different purposes.** Large ceiling heights for large gatherings; alcoves for two people. (× [density reference (Art of Gathering)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^density-reference))
		- Don't accentuate the ceiling if it's too high. No drapes or high artwork.
			- **Dark ceilings shrink. Light ceilings enlarge.** Make the room lower by painting the ceiling in a darker tone than the walls.
				- For furniture, it's the opposite: dark furniture looks larger, light furniture looks smaller. Slipcover sofas as needed.
				- Lighter sides & darker wall at the end of a hallway to enlarge it. Artwork on both sides of a hallway to make it narrower.
			- Accentuate the lower level — plants, rugs, decoration.
			- Accentuate horizontal lines (in artwork — seascapes, landscapes).
		- Low rooms need more skylight.
			- Add vertical lines (in artwork — trees). Paint the ceiling (and walls) a lighter tone.
	- **Area rugs to fill empty space** — if opposed to furniture.
	- **Focal points on a single or on adjacent walls — not on opposite walls.**
	- No open knife blocks or racks in the kitchen — they make it easy for burglars to steal your life.
	- **Hide work** with a (shoji) screen — or cover it with a cloth.
	- **Cover large mirrors if they cover you** ­— with a curtain.
	- **Balance bathrooms** — balance the wetness with something warm. (Also in the bedroom) Warm earth tones. Minimize blue & water images. Frame your bathroom mirror to add texture. Add (fake) candles.
		- Toilets further back when you enter the bathroom. Adds privacy.
	- **Multi-purpose rooms**: sofa beds / futons (to redesign the space).
	- Items stored away in closed containers/drawers (or tucked away) — to ease the mind.
- Social design
	- **Relaxed seating arrangements.** Not formal. Max 2.5m apart (no large void between seating areas). (× [design the space (Art of Gathering)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^design-the-space))
		- **Round tables.**
		- **Seats arranged at an angle** in the seating area (on the area rug).
		- **Seats not directly facing each other** — "confrontation position" (vital organs at the front of the body). If you have to, prefer a dining table to a coffee table — protecting vital organs.
	- Sensuality: drapes, soft fabrics, candlelight or soft lights (or lights through shoji screens; salt lamps), elegant colors, relaxation, carpets, room not too large. No pictures of your uncle or your ex.
	- Partnership: [pairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twJdJL6oKFY) of [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNmWCHoWGZk) (in artwork, furniture — artwork that symbolizes what you want to prime). If you want to get laid, clone every item in your room.
	- Bedroom artwork is especially effective — last thing you see, first thing you see.
- **Future-proof long-term investments** — conservative taste.
- **Stage design / set design as feng shui** — designing the space for the occasion.

- Compass School Feng Shui
	- Symbols
		- Fire: cones, pyramids, triangles (like a flame); sunset, sundown; candles, stoves.
		- Earth: square, cubes, rectangles; mountains, deserts; granite, porcelain.
		- Metal: circles, arches, ovals; silver, gray, white, pastel colors; metal furniture & items (bowls, sculptures, picture frames, trays, décor, candlesticks).
	- Metal is the element of children, creativity, creation.
	- Direct water towards your home rather than away from it. (If you have a [water fountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-KulvW2TUQ) ( with water in it))
^
- Space clearing & house blessings (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %})) — also as a ritual (× drugs, [Tiny Experiments]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-08-04-tiny-experiments-anne-laure-le-cunff-summary.md %})); when ringing in a new period in a place (move of new roommates — clearing previous roommates' energy — setting a new intention for the place).
	- Manipulate a space's energy with sound. Clear a space with sound. **Elevate the energy of a room with sound.** "A room remembers the energies that have been there — it stays in the walls, the furniture, the air." "Paraphrasing with quotation marks is misleading." (× Dose of Pleasure "activations")
	- **A space clearing *erases* an energy imprint; a house blessing *creates* an energy imprint.** First have a clean slate, before you can start painting. Incense, songs.

- **"A home is a home when it shelters the body and comforts the soul."** (Phillip Moffitt) (alternatively, [home is wherever I'm with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjFaenf1T-Y))

- **Counseling:** ask about vision & dreams, when the current state sucks.

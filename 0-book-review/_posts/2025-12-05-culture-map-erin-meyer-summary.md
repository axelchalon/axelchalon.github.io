*Here are my notes on Erin Meyer's* The Culture Map.
<br>
---
<br>
- **Communication style: explicit/implicit** (direct/indirect).
	- **Implicit cultures** (Asia, to a lesser extent France (Jean de la Fontaine, rewriting letters politely, etc.))
		- **Implicit cultures emerge from a long shared history, often relationship-based.**
			- (× [Kitchen Confidential]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-12-22-kitchen-confidential-anthony-bourdain-summary.md %}), [Shop Class as Soulcraft]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-10-23-shop-class-as-soulcraft-summary.md %}): time spent together making for inside jokes etc.; subcultures (TPOT))
			- Long-term couples know each other well, pick up on subtle cues; high context cultures (implicit) as requiring emotional intelligence.
			- Insular history: e.g. Japan (no overseas contact for a long time)
		- **<span style="position:relative; top: 10px;">"No"</span> is said between the lines.** (Asia — especially to clients/bosses)
			- People refuse out of politeness, have to be [asked twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_5OsEPp4A) again to tell the real answer.
			- Soft refusals to protect the other's [face]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-12-05-culture-map-erin-meyer-summary.md %}#^face) (as if masks weren't enough).
				- **Take “soft no’s” (changing subject, vague postponements) seriously in indirect cultures.**
		- Implicit cultures have fewer words (more context-dependent meanings); explicit cultures have more words (precise meanings). French (implicit) vs English (explicit).
		- **Implicit cultures are the least intercompatible.** The biggest misunderstandings happen between two different implicit cultures — as they both assume different things.
	- **Explicit cultures** (all Anglo-Saxon countries, USA first and to a lesser extent UK (British humour)).
		- **Explicit cultures emerge as a need from a recent, multi-cultural history.** (USA)
		- Explicit cultures are often task-based.
		- Explicit cultures favour showing interest explicitly in courting (NL, DE, USA).
- **Negative feedback** (direct/indirect negative feedback)
	- No link between explicit/implicit & direct/indirect negative feedback.
		- (Quadrant A) NL, DE, DK, AU: Explicit & direct.
		- (Quadrant B) France, Russia, Spain, Italy, Israel: Implicit & direct
		- (Quadrant C) USA (to a lesser extent GB, CA): Explicit & indirect
			- Three positives for one negative. 
			- Negative feedback in positive language.
			- Soften the negative feedback you give. Use qualifiers.
		- (Quadrant D) Asia (particularly JP, TH, ID): Implicit & very indirect (— though indirectness can be overruled by hierarchy.)
			- Deliver the negative feedback slowly over time, "so it gradually sinks in".
			- Use food & drink to blur an unpleasant message.
			- The Chinese are relatively more direct than the Japanese.
	- Indirectness can be overruled by hierarchy (Asia, Russia): indirect towards the boss but direct towards subordinates.
	- **Your culture determines whether you can hear the negative feedback given to you.** (× emotional intelligence; reading the room, Japanese "reading the air", KY/kuuki yomenai, "someone who cannot read the air", who doesn't pick up on social cues)
- <a name="^persuasion"></a>**Persuasion** (principles/practical ; theory/practice)
	- **Principles vs practice**
		- **Principles:** (DE, FR)
			- **Start with philosophy, principles, the big picture.** Start with the abstract.
			- Management: explain why.
			- (deductive)
		- **Practical:** (USA)
			- **Get to the point quickly; use case studies; expected benefits/results; glitter.**
			- Management: just give orders.
			- Start with the concrete — real-world observations, extrapolate to conclusions, recommendations.
			- (inductive - × [Psychedelics Revealing]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^inference-vs-experience), × [theories looking for applications and v/v]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-03-skin-in-the-game-summary.md %}#^theories-looking-for-applications); **experience calling for understanding**)
		- Shows in:
			- Theoretical vs practical schooling
			- Common Law (USA/UK), practical first (setting a precedent) vs civil law (EU), principles-first.
	- <a name="^holistic-specific"></a>**Holistic vs specific**
		- Asian cultures & religions tend to be more holistic (reflexology, [feng shui]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-09-29-feng-shui-that-makes-sense-cathleen-mccandless-summary.md %}), etc.)
		- **Micro-to-macro (West), vs macro-to-micro (JP, CN)**
			- Profile picture as a close-up face shot (West) vs whole-body-in-context shot (Japan).
			- In China:
				- Addresses: province, city, district, block, gate number
				- Names: Surname first
				- Date: Year before month and date
		- Management: explain the broader context / bigger picture in holistic cultures. (What colleagues are working on, how it all fits together.)
- **Hierarchy** (hierarchical/egalitarian)
	- **Historically, cultures influenced by the Romans (hierarchical, togas) vs Vikings (egalitarian)** Spain & Italy vs Scandinavia.
	- **Historically, Protestant cultures (egalitarian) vs Catholic cultures (hierarchical).** Talking to God directly, not though a priest.
	- Hierarchical cultures:
		- Shake hands first with the boss.
			- In (online) communication, do not bypass the boss to talk to lower colleagues.
		- Address informally everyone in descending rank.
		- Invite subordinates to speak up (else they won't)
	- In East Asia, use hybrid name/titles as a good compromise — "Mr. Mike".
- **Decision process** (top-down/consensual)
	- **Hierarchy and decision style can be at odds.**
		- Germany and Japan are hierarchical but consensus-based.
	- **Top-down decisions are more flexible; consensual decisions are more definitive** and can be implemented fast, as everyone is onboard.
	- [Nemawashi]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^nemawashi) (JP): **getting informal buy-in (consensus) before officially announcing the decision.** Do it as a Westerner as well. (× "Being at the [gemba]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^gemba)" with frontline workers)
	- Ringi (JP): low-level managers reaching a consensus among themselves before bringing the issue to the higher-level manager.
- **Trusting** (task-based/relationship-based)
	- Historically, cultures with no strong legal framework became relationship-based.
		- (But also: in-group cultures & knowing everyone, [Debt]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-20-debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber-summary.md %}))
	- **Cognitive trust vs affective trust**: action-based trust vs emotional-based trust. Cognitive vs personal trust. "Business is business" vs "business is personal."
		- Westerners (US) separate the person from the business; CN/BR does not.
	- Task-based
		- "—Why can't we just get down to business and sign a contract? —Remember, in many cultures, **the relationship *is* your contract**." (× [Debt]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-20-debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber-summary.md %}), [Money]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-05-09-money-unauthorized-biography-felix-martin-summary.md %}))
		- Relationships with colleagues usually stop with their employment.
		- Cold calls are okay.
	- Relationship-based (BRIC: BR, RU, IN, CN)
		- Nomunication (JP): **drinks with coworkers & managers.** (× [Trying Not to Try]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-04-15-trying-not-to-try-slingerland-summary.md %})) If drinks are not for you, then karaoke, or spa.
		- **Share more meals, get to know them personally. Show your non-professional self.**
		- Cold calls are disfavoured. **Ask a common friend to introduce you.** (× [The Mom Test]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-08-04-mom-test-rob-fitzpatrick-summary.md %}#^cold-approaches) — the goal of cold approaches is to stop having them.)
		- Fire a salesperson and their clients will leave.
		- **"Trust is like insurance — it's an investment you need to make up front, before the need arises"**
	- [Peach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MZhaX8P3W8) vs [coconut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-aXOJXreTk). Hard shell but soft inside (RU); soft outside (friendly) but quickly hitting the hard kernel (BR).
- **Disagreement** (confrontational/avoidant)
	- Historically:
		- Avoidant cultures, from needing to preserve unity (USA — melting-pot of cultures)
		- **"Harmony should be valued and quarrels should be avoided" — Japanese constitution.**
	- <a name="^face"></a>"[Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lat6Jz5WlQ)" (as line/role, persona — e.g. acting out "a professor specialized in cross-cultural management") (× [To The Actor]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-18-michael-chekhov-to-the-actor-summary.md %}))
		- Don't put JP people on the spot ­— give them time to prepare.
- **Time** (linear/flexible)
	- **Historically based on how predictable or unpredictable life is in a country.**
	- Relationship-based cultures tend to be flexible-time (giving spontaneous time to the relationships.)
	- Brazilian culture: "Impolite to arrive on time — it will stress the host scrambling to finish preparations"
	- Chinese are punctual but flexible — Japanese are more organized and linear.
^
- **Countries' positions on the scale are relative to your own culture — not absolute.** An implicit culture can still be explicit compared to yours. (× ["most people need it, but not you" (Psycho-Cybernetics)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#^but-not-you))
- Countries' positions on the scales correspond to the middle of their bell curve.
- Education tends to exaggerate the cultural tendency.
^
- **One can travel the world without learning about the other cultures.** Challenge accepted.
- Work in hospitality with a multicultural clientele to learn first-hand from the different cultures and adapt your behaviour accordingly (cf A).
^
- <a name="^meta"></a>**Meta-discuss communication & cultural styles.**
	- **Making explicit and clarifying always helps.** (× directness (relationships) (Pavlina, etc.)) (× communication, [Sex Talks]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}), [Come As You Are]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-03-emily-nagoski-come-as-you-are-summary.md %}),  butter, etc.) — especially when you're coming from different cultures. Doing the dance of implicitness only works if you come from the same culture.
- Working in multi-cultural teams:
	- Explain the cultural differences and how to reconcile them
	- Enforce explicit communication.
	- e.g. 1-minute "How I Work" document (× Parity) — to bridge across cultures (though it makes everyone have to adapt to each person.)
- Let the people in your team culturally best at something, to do it when the ~~new york~~ times call. (e.g. providing indirect negative feedback; being flexible, etc.)
^
- **Self-deprecate your culture and flatter the other's** — when confronted with a cultural issue or making a [fax piss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZVBTtX92Nc). **Laugh about your own culture.** (× [Sex Talks: laugh about it]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^laugh-about-it))
^
- Meta: Elements of Book Writing (× [Tiny Experiments]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-08-04-tiny-experiments-anne-laure-le-cunff-summary.md %}#^book-writing))
	- Start the book with a story
	- Monetize by charging for the full information (Culture Map Online Tool) (not revealing the whole knowledge but just providing a preview in the book — dark arts). Charging for access to a database (to people who can afford it.)

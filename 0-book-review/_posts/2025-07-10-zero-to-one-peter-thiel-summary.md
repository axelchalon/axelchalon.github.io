*Here are my notes on* Zero to One *by Peter Thiel.*

<br>
^
- **Vertical vs horizontal progress (technology vs globalization; 0-to-1 vs 1-to-n; innovating vs copying)** — though a copy can be a local innovation.
- **Irreproducible: every moment in history happens only once.** Every business moment happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The seminal moments of history won't happen again. Everything is a product of its context (× [At the Existentialist Café]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-05-22-at-the-existentialist-cafe-sarah-bakewell-summary.md %}#^context))
	- **"You can't be the Google of 2014; but you can be the Google of 1999."**
- "**It is better to risk boldness than triviality.**" Err on the side of boldness. (× **[Art of Gathering (make it bold)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^bold)**; × [Creative Being]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}); × [no transition (Creative Being)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^no-transition);  ×[ask big questions (How to Know a Person)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^big-questions);  ×[make bold choices before you are ready (Improvise)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^bold-choices-before-ready); × [make bold, clear decisions (assertiveness) (Improvise)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^bold-clear-decisions))

# Sales & Customer Acquisition
- **Pay people to sign up.** Pay people to refer friends. Build your user base (if value is in numbers — if your company's based on the network effect).
- **Customer Lifetime Value vs Customer Acquisition Cost.** Know the value of your customers to know how much you can afford to spend on them.
	- Alternatively, consider the value of your user base in future cash flows.
- **If you cannot spend on individual prospects, use the megaphone** — mass advertising.
^
- **Advertising works — even if you think you're immune to it.** Advertising doesn't make you buy it now — but it will make you buy it later. Advertising primes **brand awareness**.
- **Advertising seems irrational to nerds.** But it still works, and is necessary — so do it.
- **You can succeed with superior sales and a standard product — but not with poor sales and a superior product.**
	- **Poor sales are the most common cause of failure** — not poor products.
	- **If you have a great product but don't manage to sell it — you have bad business.** No matter how strong your product, you must still support it with a strong distribution plan.
		- **If you can get just one distribution channel to work — you have a great business.**
- Keep good relations to the press (PR) — for when a prospect googles your company. Protect your company's reputation.

# Monopolyamorists & non-monopolyamorists
- Monopoly: a company so good at what it does that no other firm can compete. **Be excellent at what you are doing.** (× Lynchpin (Seth Godin)).
	- **Strive for 10x better products than the competition (e.g. ChatGPT) — incremental improvements are invisible to the end user.** End users must realize that your product is vastly better than the competition.
	- **Great businesses are defined by the possibility of future cash flows.**
- **Ingredients to monopoly**
	- **Proprietary technology**
		- **Covert marketplace:** Amazon started off as online bookstore but without storing any physical inventory — just requesting the titles from suppliers when a customer made an order. (× supreme JIT; [continuous flow (Toyota Way)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^continuous-flow))
		- **Human-in-the-loop**: machines assisting humans, not replacing them. ([supervised automation (Toyota Way)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^supervised-automation))
		- Futurists vs luddites.
	- **Network effect:** the more people use it, the more useful — the upside: the more people around you use it, the more sense it makes for you to use it.
		- **Start with small markets.** "Always err on the side of starting too small." (e.g. Amazon started with books; Facebook with Harvard)
			- **Conquer the market one niche at a time** (eBay starting with Beany Baby obsessives, etc.)
		- **Viral marketing:** a product is viral if it encourages users to invite their friends to become users too. (Facebook, PayPal) **Exponential growth through viral marketing** — when every new user leads to more than one additional new user.
	- **Economies of scale**: costs remain fixed as the company scales. (× [no cost of replication (Naval)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-07-25-almanack-naval-ravikant-summary.md %}#^no-cost-of-replication)) (× writing/making a theater piece — you can perform it the following year with minimum effort)
	- **Branding.** Strong, unique brand. **A company has monopoly over its branding by definition.** Use it!
- Monopolies vs competitive firms:
	- **Monopolies set their own prices**; competitive firms base their prices on the competition.
	- **Monopolies can think long term**; competitive firms are obsessed about short-term survival & profit (to a fault).
		- **Safety is needed to go beyond survival.** (× people) Long-term thinking needs short-term sacrifices that small companies cannot afford (without e.g. funding), as they have to prioritize survival.
	- Monopolies (e.g. bureaucracies) don't have inherent incentives for providing quality.
- **Avoid competition as much as you can** — target markets uncatered-for.
	- **If you cannot beat a rival, it may be better to merge.**
- **Growth vs durability trap:** growth is easy to measure, durability is not. It's easy to obsess over short-term metrics ([Measure What Matters]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}); [rigged metrics (Skin in the Game)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-03-skin-in-the-game-summary.md %}#^rigged-metrics)) but to miss the big picture (durability).
- **Which market is your reference?** You might be a monopolist in one but a non-monopolist in the other (in the larger market).
- **Pre-mortem the competition frying you.**
^
# Teams
- **No company *has* a culture; each company *is* a culture.** (× [deliberate company culture (The Toyota Way)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^deliberate-culture))
	- "A startup is **a team of people on a mission**."
	- "The early PayPal team worked well together because we were **all the same kind of nerd**."
- **Hire people who match professionally but also personally** — that you would actually enjoy working together with.
- **Make every employee responsible for one thing, and one thing only.** (× [single responsibility (Essentialism)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^single-responsibility) Evaluate them on that thing only. **Defined roles reduce conflict**.
- **Business partner: think of what can go wrong and prepare for it.** (× prenup agreements, [I Will Teach You To Be Rich]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-02-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary.md %}); [pre-mortem (Clear Thinking)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^pre-mortem))
	- When investing in a company — pay close attention the relationship between the founders, how well they know each other, how well they work together, etc. Companies implode as much as they explode.
- Board of Directors: ideally 3 people, and no more than 5.
- Equity helps aligning everyone's interests with the company.

- "Cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something important."

# Venture investing
- Venture investing: **Invest only in companies with the potential for extreme returns.** — as opposed to a diversified, conservative portfolio (× [I Will Teach You To Be Rich]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-02-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary.md %})). A diversified portfolio inherently excludes high-risk high-return companies by definition.
	- **Diversified, low-risk investing is less agentic.** "Whenever you shift from the substance of a business to the financial question of whether or not it fits into a diversified hedging strategy, venture investing starts to look a lot like buying lottery tickets. And once you think that you're playing the lottery, you've already psychologically preparing yourself to lose."
- **Venture investing epitomizes and encourages going all-in.** — and encourages companies to do so (high-risk, high-reward).
	- **Schools are about hedging and safety — not going all-in.** Schools encourage diversified skills and equal commitments (cf 45-min classes for every subject.) (arguably, mediocrity).
^
- **Finance is for people who don't how (else) to create value.** (M+M=M; [Money]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-05-09-money-unauthorized-biography-felix-martin-summary.md %})) "Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth."

*Here are my notes on Priya Parker's The Art of Gathering, a bright manifesto for intentionality & deliberateness.*
^
- **Start with why.**
	- Commit to one **precise** purpose. The more specific, the more people can see themselves in it.
		- e.g. Start from a vision backward. (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}))
		* e.g. "What makes this gathering special, what with where each of us is in their life?"
		* e.g. An outcome-focussed purpose for work meetings ("Reaching a decision")
	* <a name="^bold"></a>**Make it bold.**
	- You are consuming people's most precious resource, time. Decide how you want them to be altered by the experience.
	- Go beyond templates & tradition (× [legacy problem]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^legacy-problem); Conflict Communication). **Make the gathering unique.**
	* If co-hosting, align clearly on the purpose.
- <a name="^name"></a>Name well and in alignment with your purpose. Invent a name to remove associations & connotations.
- **Design a gathering of friends as a gathering of strangers** to discover new facets of your friends and unearth stories.
^
# Logistics
- **All logistical decisions should follow from the gathering's purpose.**
	* Decide on a size for your gathering: 6, 12, 30, 150.
	* **Choose a venue that embodies your gathering's purpose.**
		* Let the location inspire & prime.
			* Venues naturally bring out a specific self in people. (× [Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %})).
			* Brainstorm idea: Do the opposite (× [Trying Not to Try]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-04-15-trying-not-to-try-slingerland-summary.md %}#^do-the-opposite)). Think of where your gathering ought not to take place; do it there.
		* Once there, **design the space.** Rearrange it — it's not fixed.
			- <a name="^density-reference"></a>Let it match the scale of your event.
				* Density reference (m²/person): ![Event density reference](https://xaxel.cc/assets/artofgathering_density.png)
			* Scale down the venue based on attendance. (× ECHNO: reducing rows of chairs to match declining attendance)
			* Delineate it & close it. Contain the gathering.
- **Generous exclusion: exclude to the benefit of your guests.**
	- **No Bobs.**
		* Neutral people dilute the energy of the group.
		* Every single person changes the dynamics of the group, especially in small groups.
		* By accepting Bob, you give up a spot for somebody who could be more relevant.
		* If you want diversity, **polarize** and exclude the middle.
			* <a name="^activate-the-diversity"></a>**Activate the diversity.** (Potential vs activated diversity)
	* <a name="^no-invites-by-obligation"></a>**No invites by obligation.** (× ["Fuck Yes, or No"](https://markmanson.net/fuck-yes))
	* "**If everyone is invited, no one is invited.** By closing the door, you create the room."
	* Multi-part gatherings: attend all or none. Else the energy gets disrupted.
^
# Pre-game
- When people sign up is when the gathering begins.
- **Gather intelligence on your guests ahead of the meeting**, using e.g. one-on-ones or (possibly anonymous) pre-game workbooks (prompts). (× [The Design of Everyday Things]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^understand-people))
	* Let people contribute to the gathering as pre-game.
- **Prepare people, not things.**
^
# Anteroom
* **Make use of the "waiting-room" time**, e.g. to let guests connect with each other.
^
# Game
- **Don't be a chill host.** Exert **generous authority** (a.k.a. assertiveness in favour of the group.)
	- If you don't lead, somebody else will.
* **Lead from beginning to end.** If you have to leave, temporarily **delegate your host role.**
- **Lead by extreme example** — people will do 10% less.
- <a name="^pop-up-rules"></a>**Etiquette excludes, pop-up rules include.**
	* <a name="^leveller"></a>Pop-up rules are a leveller. (× Conflict Communication: tactical teaming).
	- Use pop-up rules to override etiquette.
	- People are willing to try things, if it's for a certain time.
		- **Gatherings are experiments** — "testing out new ways of being together" (× [Sex Talks]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}), [Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}#^self-to-self))
	* Use pop-up rules that exemplify your purpose & create a culture. (e.g. priming activities that shift the focus on others: assigning an altruistic role to each guest, e.g. "water minister" — distinct but funny titles that enforce a culture of co-responsibility.)
	- Identify counter-productive behaviour to create your pop-up rules.
	* Communicate the pop-up rules e.g. during pre-game, or at the entrance.
	* **Enforce mercilessly.** You're acting in the benefit of the group.
		* e.g. set a 60-second timer for introduction rounds and be strict about it.
		* e.g. interrupt drawn-out "questions" at a Q&A with "Can you put that into a question?"
		* <a name="^communicate-your-reasons"></a>**Communicate your reasons.** Refer to the purpose when making changes, excluding people, enforcing a rule. Explain that it's not personal, that it's in the interest of the group. (× [The Toyota Way: Mr. Ohno]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^ohno-explain-reasons))
- <a name="^invite-depth"></a>**Give guests play to decide how deep they want to go.**
	- <a name="^997489"></a>Invite, don't force.
* **Nudge risk with a riskier alternative.** (15 Toasts: "the last person to give a toast has to sing it") (× [Nudge]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-03-30-nudge-summary.md %}))
* **Prime displacement** if you want people to show up outside of their usual self. Find ways to break habits or the ordinary.
* **Create connection among guests**.
	* **Matchmake & introduce.**
		* **Matchmake** either in who you invite; or in who you sit together.
		* **Introduce commonalities.** Introductions let people be seen and give them material to connect.
	- **Ask people for stories.** Stories over ideas. Ask for turning points in people's lives; decisions they made that showcase their personality.
	* You can let anyone connect authentically. You can connect with anyone.
	- <a name="^prompt-ideas"></a>Prompt ideas
		- How have your priorities changed over the years?
		* How have your background and experience limited or favoured you?
		* Which parts of your life have been a waste of time?
		* What have you rebelled against in the past and what are you rebelling against now?
		* Share a story, a moment, or an experience that changed the way you view the world.
- Involve if you cannot oppose. (e.g. start a comedy night in a noisy bar by involving the loudmouths) (× [Trying Not to Try]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-04-15-trying-not-to-try-slingerland-summary.md %}#^do-the-opposite); Conflict Communication, tactical teaming)
^
# Opening & Closing
* <a name="^bang"></a>**Start with a bang, end with a bang.** (× [Improvise]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}))
	- **People remember the first 5%, the last 5%, and a highlight in between.**
		* Change spaces throughout to let people remember more events.
	- Let guests cross a threshold to mark the beginning and to mark the end.
	* Embody the gathering's purpose in how you start, in how you end. Recall the purpose.
- **Logistics either second or second-to-last.** Don't start or end on logistics. Don't start or end with thank you's.
- **Create belonging with your opening ritual.** something that creates commonality within the group. (Adornment, etc.) — × "pop-up rules include".
* <a name="^end-not-stop"></a>**The event should end, not stop.** Lead the event, don't let it lead you.
	- "I pronounce this lab..." — then I clap, an exit line — "closed."
* **Last Call:** prepare your guests for the ending.
- **Two steps to a close: introspection & integration.** (Turning inward & turning outward.)
	* Introspection: Reviewing what was experienced.
	* Integration: Deciding on how to adjust daily life accordingly.
- Memorable gifts (à la friendship bracelets) as closing ritual for integration.

# Post-Game
- **Export the formats that work.** mp4 is safe for YouTube.
^
# Post-Notes
- **Gatherings are intentional hangouts.**
* <a name="^worrying-about-things"></a>"One woman shared her mother's words on her deathbed: "I spent 90 percent of my time worrying about things that didn't matter. Don't do that.""

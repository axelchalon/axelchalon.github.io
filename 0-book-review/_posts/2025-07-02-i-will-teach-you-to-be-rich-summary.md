*Here are my notes on Ramit Sethi's* I Will Teach You To Be Rich *(trolling occasionally; take some statements with a pinch of sea salt and a splash of lemon juice). **[Soundtrack](https://www.tunemymusic.com/share/VkcR5r1M5C)**.*
^
- **Money is a means, not an end.** What do I want to do in my life — and how can money help with that?
	- **Have a money vision.** Know very concretely what you are earning the next 10k for.
	- Where you spend your time and money (e.g. on the Dark Side of the Moon), should be aligned with your priorities.
	- **Use money to make things.** (cf Joe Berlin: renting out a space, creating community (!)) Be an instigator ([Steve Pavlina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hFdmt9omBE))
^
# systemz
- **Create a system so you can forget about it.** Set up once, benefit forever.
- **Current account as e-mail inbox** — receive income and redistribute (automatically) to the appropriate account. Automatic withdraws rather than sends.
	- **Set up automatic monthly transfers to your savings account, investment account and spending money.**
	- **Have saving goals in your saving accounts** — emergency fund (esp. for irregular income — 3× monthly expenses to buffer, × [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %})), income tax (freelancers), vacation/retreat, other projects / pending purchases). Savings are about projects, short-, medium- or long-term.
	- **Keep ~1k€ in your current account as buffer.**
- **Acquire the right habits today, for tomorrow.** Build the right habits now so you already have them when you start growing money. Put aside even a small amount of money every month. (The future begins today. (Aperture Science))
- **Recurring bills on the same day.** Call subscription companies and reschedule billing day. Simplifies your cash flow management (esp. with a monthly salary).
- **Systems make it easier to decline invites.** "It's not personal, it's just my system" (× [Essentialism]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}), [Clear Thinking]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}), "Sorry, it's not a priority." "Sorry, I'm focussing on X at the moment." "What else should I de-prioritize?")

# smart money
- **Conscious spending:** cut costs on things you don't love, spend extravagantly on things you love. (× [Essentialism]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}))
	- Decide on what you don't love, don't care about, don't mind — e.g. living in a shared flat, furniture, clothes, subscriptions, possessions, etc. Cut costs. Cancel subscriptions or sell items. (× [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-10-15-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-summary.md %})) (× [endowment effect (Essentialism)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^endowment))
	- Decide on what you do love, care about, value — education, learning, experiences, art, etc.
^
- **Conscious Spending Plan**: fixed costs (50-60%), investments (10%), savings (5-10%), guilt-free spending money (20-35%) — alternatively: "60% solution": 60% fixed costs, 40% other (10% investments, 10% short-term savings, 10% long-term savings, 10% fun)
	- Add 15% to your estimate of fixed costs (as safety buffer for occasional costs (× [Clear Thinking (2x margin of safety)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^margin-of-safety).
	- Windfalls, extra savings: save half, spend half.

# cut & earn
- **There's a limit ~~to your love~~ to how much you can cut; not to how much you can earn.** (× [remove to perfection (Creative Being)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^remove-to-perfection); [reduce priorities (Essentialism)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^reduce-priorities))
- **cut ~~caught merger~~**
	- **Know your biggest expenses.** Have visibility on where you spend money (and where you could cut costs.)
	- **Reduce spending incrementally** (or increase them decrementally). Cutting 15€ from your eating out expenses each month (until reaching your cutting goal, chop chop) is more sustainable and prone to stay. Don't quit cold turkey, but cut it in slices.
	- **Review all of your subscriptions.** Start from scratch, then review each subscription one by one, decide if you want to keep them. (× zero-[based](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/us/17xp-pepethefrog_web1/28xp-pepefrog-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp) budgeting ([Essentialism]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^zero-based)))
	- **One-offs instead of subscriptions.** À La Carte method (Cartman method): replace subscriptions with one-off purchases (e.g. bandcamp (like Songtradr did)).
	- Budget Jones's Diary
		- **Limited credits** (budgeting): set a monthly budget for certain leisure expenses, switch to cheap options after you've spent it. "I allow up to $300 for eating out and coffee each month and when I exhaust this, I turn to instant coffee and packing my lunch."
		- **Mid-month budgeting check + course-correct**
- **earn**
	- **Negotiate higher pay.** Reach for the moon, shoot at the stars.
		- Top Performer method:
			- On joining, ask what it would take to be a top performer. Set a concrete goal. Agree that you will discuss salary again if you reach the goal. Commit to history by a follow-up mail.
			- Meticulously track your impact in your projects. (Ask someone experienced at work on what to track if at a loss.) Regularly update your boss on your progress. (Though: [rigged metrics (Skin in the Game)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-03-skin-in-the-game-summary.md %}#^rigged-metrics); × [OKR]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}))
			- A few months before the review, ask your boss if you're on the right track.
			- Just before the review, ask for a colleague to put in a good word for you. Bribe as needed.
			- Role-play the negotiation with friends with negotiation experience who can give you feedback — videotape it (send it to your boss). Visualizations (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %})). Know what to say in every eventuality. "**Negotiation is 90% mindset and 10% tactics**"
			- At the review: come with a print-out of the e-mail chain, evidence of your impact on the project and company, competitive salaries (Glassdoor, Wageindicator, (former) coworkers). Threaten to switch companies if needed. Re-negotiate salary. **"You're not asking your mum for lemonade, you're a professional who's asking to be compensated fairly."** ("Sir, I'm not asking you for lemonade...")
		- **Research the job posting & the company.** Have relevant experience to show for every line of the job posting. Know about the company. Already mention ideas or a plan for improving the company.
			- Ask "What qualities make someone do an extraordinary job in this position?" then show that you have past experience doing that. **Have a repertoire of accomplishments and aptitudes at your fingertips that you mention in responses to commonly asked questions.** (Success stories at previous jobs — e.g. CM)
		- **The best time to negotiate is when you start a new job.** This is the time when you have the most leverage, and will be the baseline for future raises.
			- Ask people at the company (better: people no longer at the company) how much they get, or how much you can expect or how much you can negotiate.
		- Let the employer do the first offer. "What's a fair number that we can both work from?"
		- **Negotiating means you value yourself more than the average employee.** (× [Never Split the Difference]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-06-01-never-split-the-difference-summary.md %}))
		- When negotiating, **demonstrate the value you are bringing to the company.** (e.g. bringing own gear, no need for training, own costs (QLab), consistency/show control). Highlight how you'll make your boss's life easier, or how you'll make them look good.
		- **Don't ask yes/no questions. Not "Can you do 55k?" but "How can we get to 55k?"**.
		- Ask for **lopsided perks** ([lopside is the right side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daXKU-tCR8o)) (× [lopsided perks (Never Split the Difference)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-06-01-never-split-the-difference-summary.md %}#^non-cash-extras)). "Let's talk about total compensation"
		- **Smile.** Like the Beach Boys.
		- Incantations
			- "Let's find a way to arrive at a **fair number** that works for both of us."
			- "How can we get to 55k?"
			- "I'm not comfortable revealing my salary, so let's move on. What else can I answer for you?"
	- **Negotiate lower fees.**
		- **No yes/no questions. Request, don't ask.** (Don't ask, don't tell.) Make statements, be assertive. (× [principles of assertiveness (Improvise)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^bold-clear-decisions)) (× [Never Split the Difference]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-06-01-never-split-the-difference-summary.md %}))
		- Incantations
			- "I'd like X, please." (my account to have free transactions and no minimum balance, please.)
			- "What can you do to X?" (remove the late fee?)
			- "I'd like to X." (have this removed.)
			- "I'd like to X. What else can you do to help me?"
			- "I'd like to X. Do I need to do do anything besides ask right here on the phone?"
		- Track phone calls to institutions & outcomes — so you can refer back to previous calls contents (with precision) when calling. This scares people.
		- **Threaten to leave,** or to go to the competitor (mention attracting fees). The longer you've been at a bank, the higher value you are to them. Leverage this; use it as argument. "I've been a customer at yours for over 5 years." Banks don't want to lose you.
		- **Negotiate in person or on the phone,** not by mail or over ICQ.
	- **Small jobs on the side.** You have many skills you don't realize you can get paid for (e.g. dance lessons). Have a look at Craigslist. Passive income.

# investingmentness
(running out of ink so being a bit more sparing with bolding in this section)
^
- **Invest in yourself, invest in your career.** There is often no better investment.
- **Invest every month, for a long time.**
	- **The longer you save, the less you have to save each month.** Save long and prosper.
	- Send money to your investment account each month, proportionally into your different funds.
	- When getting started: save towards one investment fund at a time (minimum deposit). Asset allocation (assal for short) doesn't have to be perfect from the get-go — it can take a few years until you reach your balanced portfolio. Create sub-savings goals.
^
- Asset allocation (stock vs bonds) vs diversification (within an asset class)
	- Asset allocation and diversification model: eg Swensen (or e.g. p241, example with Vanguard).
- Actively managed mutual funds (overpriced, avoid); index funds (passively managed, good, low fees); target date funds (hands-off but not very accessible in the NL). If going the index funds route, typically invest in several to diversify. **Rebalance every 12 months or so.** (× enjoy your roots, have some funds ([kids on holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NtMtW2ven4), animal collective))
^
- To evaluate a fund, look at its track record over the last 10 years or more.
- Frequent trading typically costs tax.
^
- **Look for low fees.** A 1% fee can reduce your return by 30%, a 2% fee can half your investment return.  A 1% fee is massive. Anything above 0.75% is expensive. **For index funds, look for management fees around 0.2%**.
	- **When picking a fund, know all the fees.**
^
- **FIRE and LeanFIRE(!)**
	- **FIRE/LeanFIRE is a decision.** And if you want to reach it, you can choose how to achieve it. Decide in how many years you want to reach your crossover point and make a plan to reach it by then – how it would translate to how much to invest each month and how much to earn each month. (But don't forget to live.)
^
- **[Rule of 72](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nFQw97VqIeZ4awod9k39Ep0OJx10p150A)**: divide 72 by the interest rate to get the years it will take to double your investment. If you invest every month, it compounds even more.
^
- Cautious with buying real estate: make sure your portfolio is still diversified, that you're not investing it all into the house. A house should just be one item in your portfolio.
	- Buying a house only makes sense if you're staying there 10+ years.
	- Having a house has a lot of hidden costs + the cost of not having the money in the stock market.
- "Heart investing": 10% of your portfolio for projects you want to support (a.k.a. small-scale angel investing) -- only after you have your portfolio completely set-up and diversified.
^
# misc
- **Baltimore Stockbroker Scam** (prediction scam): have a large pool of people; tell half that Option A is going to win, the other half that Option B is going to win. Ditch whichever group you gave the wrong prediction. Repeat within the smaller group. Some people will have you seen making the right prediction e.g. 10x in a row.
	- Forecasting needs to be public (and irreversible) for it to have value.
- Automate monthly transfers to charity.
- Offer a meeting time and location directly upon reaching out ("Are you available for a short talk? **If so**, would Monday at 2pm work for you?")
- **"It's important to me."** (x CM)

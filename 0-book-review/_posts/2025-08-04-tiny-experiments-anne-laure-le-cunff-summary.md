*Here are my notes on Anne-Laure Le Cunff's book* Tiny Experiments.
^
<p><br>---</p>
<br>
- **Tiny Experiments as operating system.** Tiny Experiment all the things! 
^
- **Linear goals are boring because predictable. Pacts are iterative and invite reinvention.** Climbing up career ladder vs time-bound experiments.
^
- **A pact is not a habit.** A habit doesn't have a time limit; a pact has.
^
- **Stability is a prerequisite for exploration.** "It's harder to stay curious when your life is unstable" Stability so you can focus on other (more important) things. Getting rid of the urgent to focus on the important.
^
- Try longer commitments: 3 months, 6 months... (× [long hangouts (The Art of Gathering)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-12-30-priya-parker-art-of-gathering-summary.md %}#^long-hangouts))
- Tiny Experiments (commitments) are like jumping into a river: you just have to (make the decision to) jump; once you're in the air, the rest inexorably follows. (× "Jump!" (DO Lectures))
- Performances are tiny experiments — committing to performing on a certain date; and sticking through it the whole two hours, "the show must go on".
- × Micro-adventures (Alastair Humphreys)
- Software trial periods as tiny experiments.
^
- **Focus full-time on a project**. "He left his job at Wall Street and created a blog."
- **Announcing a goal makes you less likely to complete it.** (× [those who do should talk, and those who talk should do (Skin in the Game)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-03-skin-in-the-game-summary.md %}#^talkers-doers)
^
- Setting up your experiment
	- **Pact MVP** (Think tiny): What's the smallest version of this experiment that you can run?
	- **Think of your worst day.** Design your pact so you can still do it on difficult days.
	- **You don't have to go bigger.** "Persist": resist the temptation to one-up if the experiment was successful. (× [things that don't scale (Skin in the Game)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-03-skin-in-the-game-summary.md %}#^unscalable); Degrowth)
		- "I wanted to meditate once a week in a group. This does not require me to build a big meditation organization."
^
- **Make videos / Record yourself.** "A new mode of expression."
	- "I made a pact to film myself every day for ten days and to share it online. This experiment unlocked an entirely new mode of expression to add to my creative repertoire."
^
- **Cold curiosity vs hot curiosity** (rational vs emotional curiosity). Make experiments at the intersection.
- <a name="^procrastination-messenger"></a>**Procrastination is a sign.** Procrastination indicates a mismatch between head, heart, hand: rationality, emotions, abilities. Don't shoot the messenger; listen to it. procrastination is not the enemy.
	- Head: Redefine strategy
	- Heart: Redesign the experience
	- Hand: Request support (delegate) or get training
^
- **Partnered experiments.** Partnered pacts. (Partnered commitments.)
	- Commit with a partner on trying out something for a set period of time. E.g. with romantic or sexual partners.
		- "Let's get married for one year." "Let's have a fake wedding and see how it feels." "Let's live together for a week." (e.g. handfasting (temporary marriage))
	- **Trial period.** "You cannot know if you would like to live in a city by spending one afternoon there." (× [trial decisions (Clear Thinking)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^trial-decision))
- **Tiny experiment your life**: successive periods, all time-bound. (Regular travels.)
^
- **Re-intentionalize regularly** — not once a year. Review your efforts, strategize, try new things. Get inspired every week!
- **Notice what is absent.** Go through your journal and notice what you never talk about, think about, or feel. "Data can tell you a lot through what is not there."
^
- **The personal is the universal.** Both personal and universal (e.g. hero's journey, [The Hero With a Thousand Faces]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-02-joseph-campbell-hero-thousand-faces-summary.md %})).
- **A community gives you access to extra knowledge, skills and physical assets that vastly exceed your own.** (× [extended intelligence (The Singularity is Near)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-10-singularity-is-near-ray-kurzweil-summary.md %}))
- **Breaking the Game**: Asking users how to monetize the website.
	- (Open Startup movement — writing about your learnings as you are building your product (e.g. analytics))
- **Personal reviews in team meetings.** Plus Minus Next: What went well, what didn't, action steps.
^
- **We tend to narrow down potential friendships as we age** — for better or for worse. (We become less open as we age — × [psychedelics increase the personality trait of openness]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-10-aidan-lyon-psychedelic-experience-revealing-mind-summary.md %}#^psychedelics-openness); [openness (big 5 personality trait)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^big-5))
	- "As we mature we progressively narrow the scope and variety of our lives. Of all the interests we might pursue, we settle on a few. **Of all the people with whom we might associate, we select a small number.** We become caught in a web of fixed relationships. We develop set ways of doing things."
^
- **Cryptic patents:** scientists used to publish their findings in anagrams — letting them claim priority while disclosing them only when they saw fit. (anagrammatic secrecy; Kepler)
^
- Overcoming stage fright: "**In a hundred years, you'll be dead, and so will every single person in the audience.** So quit worrying and get out there."
- "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain." (Vivian Greene)
	- (× "Never walk when you can dance" (Marshall Rosenberg))
	- "Dance with disruption. When life's song abruptly changes, relax and listen. Stay nimble. **Explore your subjective experience with curiosity before confronting the objective consequences of the disruption.** Then chaos can become a source of transformation."  (× Antifragile)
- **Not all time is equal.** Objective vs subjective time (chronos vs kairos). One's objective lifetime is distinct from one's subjective lifetime — live big.
^
- "8 weeks of rowing until you reach flow." Practices need a certain time until you reach flow; commit the course for a few weeks to reach flow, and then decide. (Lenar, [Flow]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-07-05-flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-summary.md %}))
- Sprints (software development) as tiny experiments. Only ever knowing the next step (priority).

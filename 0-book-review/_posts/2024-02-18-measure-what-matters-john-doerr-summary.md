^
_Those are my personal notes on John Doerr's book “Measure What Matters — OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth"._
^
Nota: OKR = Objective & Key Results: a clear impact-focussed goal with a deadline, along with measurable steps necessary to reach it.
# Core values, mission statement
* A company's mission statement, vision, and core values are a general guideline for behaviour and decision-making.
	* Examples of mission statements:
		* "We envision a world where anyone, anywhere, can transform their lives by accessing the world's best learning experience."
		* "Every American has a right to delicious, affordable, healthy food."
	* Examples of core values (Coursera):
		* "Students first."
		* "Great partners: Be a great partner to universities."
		* "Think big and advance pedagogy."
		* "Care for teammates and be human, be humble."
		* "Do good, do well: Experiment and develop a sustainable business model."
^
# Culture
* **OKRs might need a culture change before being implemented.** "We didn't want bureaucratic compliance. We wanted enthusiastic compliance."
	* Culture makes unnecessary the bureaucratic enforcing of standards. Culture replace rules with shared principles.
	* A great culture yields great results. By providing a culture of trust, risk-taking is not judged, but instead encouraged, which yields to more engagement and exceptional results.
* Shape the culture as early as possible, at its inception. Later is harder (cost of change).
* <a name="^challenge-ceo"></a>Deliberately create a culture where the CEO can be challenged in their decisions by the employees.
	* **Feedback needs to be immediate to be helpful.** Favour direct feedback (over delayed feedback, e.g. annual review). Delayed feedback can make it too late to adjust. (× [Sex Talks]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}) ; [Improvise!]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^feedback))

# OKRs & benefits
* **Objectives and key results (goals and action plan) are yin & yang** (and one needing the other.) Goals come from a place of inspiration, are "passive"; while the action plan is an "effecting onto the world", aggressive.
* **Vision needs to be followed by execution.** "If the heart doesn't find a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means nothing."
	* "**The OKR framework cultivates the madness** \[(the genius)\], the chemistry \[in the band\]."
- **Top-level OKRs are based on the company's mission statement, vision.**
	* Letting everybody know: "There were close to one hundred people at the meeting. The message penetrated two levels of managers off the bat, and to a third level within twenty-four hours."
* **Day-to-day activities (and OKRs) should be aligned with, contributing towards top-level OKRs (alignment).**
	* OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities.
		* **Concentrate efforts: agree on a shared objective and way of reaching it.**
	* Clear top-level OKRs enable voluntary, aligned initiatives among frontline workers.
	* Clear top-level OKRs simplify deciding if a new project or initiative fits into the big picture or not.
	* Clear OKRs help coordinate teams.
	* Meaning arises when you know what your work is for.
- **OKRs train everyone to think like managers** (before they become one).
* **OKRs clarify what you need to be doing, at any given moment,** by providing clear priorities.
	* **OKRs let you "default to what matters"** when things get hectic or when faced with difficult decisions.
	* **OKRs make things objective**, therefore easier to reason about and discuss.
		* **OKRs simplify and expedite decision making**, both individual and collaborative.
^
# Open OKRs
* **OKR platforms are a knowledge platform.** Akin to books, open-access OKR platforms let employees draw from the wisdom and experience of other teams having faced similar objectives — and discover which key results they set, and with which outcome. (x [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}): recording experiments, expected outcomes and ultimate results for future reference; with protocol.)
- **Transparency and openness facilitate mutual support.** By transparently sharing our goals, we can understand and support each other better; we can love better (× "nurturing people's (spiritual) growth", [All About Love]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %}#^love-nurture-growth))
	* Imagine a world where people walk around with their current goals printed on their face.
	* Every person manages the business of themselves.
	* An open OKR culture requires others' OKRs to be viewed and used, not just accessible. "If you share a goal that nobody sees, is the system truly transparent?" Theoretical vs practical open OKR.
	* **It is easier to communicate a "no" when people know your priorities.**
		* Open OKRs facilitate "nos" by having a person's priorities laid out in public.
	* Open OKRs facilitate communication and understanding between teams. Open OKRs are the shared language between different teams each speaking a different "language".
	* Open OKRs encourage (spontaneous) collaboration. **OKRs create networks.** Vertically, horizontally, diagonally. "**Connected goal-setting.**"
		* "People cannot connect with what they cannot see. Networks cannot blossom in silos." And networks are more resilient!
		* **Collaboration is an engine of growth and innovation.**
	* Open OKR platforms promote internal networking.
	* Open OKRs prevent wasteful redundancy; prevents different teams from unwittingly doing the same thing.
	* Open OKRs remove suspicion as to what other people are working on (if on anything at all).
^
# <a name="^goal-setting"></a>Goal setting
* **Goals should be set with "rigor and imagination".**
* Decisiveness / Clear, structured goal-setting
	- "If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing."
	* **Any decision is better than no decision.** "Wrong decisions can be corrected once results begin to roll in. Nondecisions — or hastily abandoned ones — teach us nothing."
	* **There are often several right answers.** The leader's job is to pick one.
		* "Just make a decision." "Are you moving forward? Are you breaking ties? Let's keep rolling."
	- "The biggest risk of all is not taking one."
^
* **Make time to brainstorm on what matters most**; what the OKRs should be for the next period.
	* **Start brainstorming on the next OKRs way ahead of time.**
* <a name="^set-okrs-in-advance"></a>**Deciding ahead gives room to adjust.** Make the OKR official ahead of the kick-off, so you have time to already prepare and fine-tune it.
* **Different OKRs can have different priorities.**
^
- **Dual-tracking: have both long-term and short-term OKRs**.
	- **Actual work is driven by short-term goals**, even in the context of annual OKRs and long-term plans.
^
* <a name="^impact-not-activity"></a>**OKRs should focus on impact, not activity**; OKRs should focus on direct economic or end-user benefits.
	* Not "Launch X" but "Double fleet-wide Y by launching X to 90+ percent of borg cells."
	* Not "Launch X" but "Launch X to improve sign-ups by 25 percent" (or "Improve sign-ups by 25 percent.")
* <a name="^output-instead-of-activity"></a>**To maximize productivity, focus on output instead of activity,** Busy-ness does not equate efficiency ("**the activity trap**"). "There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little." Don't work hard, work smart. Focus on the value steam instead of surface processes ([The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^value-stream-not-surface-processes)). [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}): (excessive) busy-ness can lead to [over-burdening]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^overburden-is-detrimental) and other wastes (e.g. [over-production]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^continuous-use)).
	* "Work "on" the business, not "in" the business. (× [Trying Not to Try]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-04-15-trying-not-to-try-slingerland-summary.md %}#^in-the-world-not-of-it) (Bible) "Being in the world, but not of it.")
	- "As you move up the hierarchy, you get paid not for the amount of work you do, but for the quality of the decisions you make." When faced with a problem — pause.
* **Cross-team objectives should have different KRs for the different teams.**
	* Each team can then turn the KRs into objectives in their own right with their own KRs.
	* **Make all lateral, cross-functional dependencies explicit.** (Visually!)
* <a name="^accountability"></a>**When OKRs are collaborative, assign key results to individuals — and hold them accountable.**
	- **Co-ownership weakens accountability.** (× [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^single-point-accountability))
* <a name="^give-autonomy"></a>**Give people autonomy on how to solve problems.** "Micromanagement is mismanagement."
	* **Insight into the way to reach an objective often stems from the gemba** (frontline workers) (× [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %})).
	* **Contributors should write their own key results** to achieve the objective.
* **Roughly half the OKRs should come from frontline workers.** (× [Gemba]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^gemba))
	* "Autonomy", as setting your own goals.
	* "Every employee in my department owns three to five business objectives per quarter, along with one or two personal ones."
* **Choose the right metric.** What you measure defines what you value.
	- Make your metrics unambiguous (precise).
	* Adjust which metrics you are tracking (for your objectives) over time, as your priorities change.
- **Metrics have to be tied to a goal.** KPIs by themselves have no value.
* **Pair quantity KRs with quality KRs.** Setting quality KRs adjacent to quantity KRs safeguards against reaching a KR for the sake of reaching the KR without heeding quality, effectively defeating the initial purpose of the KR.
* **Ask for the resources needed to accomplish your OKR.** (Time, money, experts, guidance, information, etc.)
^
# Stretch goals
- **Stretch goals are about testing our limits.** Stretch goals are about checking if our limits are where we think they are.
	* **Stretch goals yield greater output**, compared to more comfortable goals.
	* **Stretch objectives call for stretch KRs.**
* At times, a company needs stretch, "10x" goals; at other times committed goals (for consolidating).
	* Visions inspire stretch goals.
	* Stretch goals: raising one's game "by orders of magnitude".
	* Stretch goals are a good way to prioritize a certain product needing a push.
	* "10x" (stretch) goals require radical, not incremental innovation. They require thinking about the problem differently (× [The Design of Everyday Things]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^incremental-radical); × re-imagining the future state ([The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^future-state))). "If you want your car to get fifty miles per gallon, fine. You can retool your car a little bit. But if I tell you it has to run on a gallon of gas for five hundred miles, you have to start over."
	* **Aiming for the stars & reaching the moon: By going for very ambitious goals, a failure still means an amazing result.** "If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you'll still achieve something remarkable." "When you aim for the stars, you may come up short but still reach the moon."
	* "Picture Everest, then describe how difficult the climb is. Then describe how we're going to reach the summit."
	* Put very ambitious goals in perspective, in context, to make it seem less crazy (e.g. by changing the reference point: +500% vs 50% of competitor's performance).
* **Chunking makes ambitious goals doable.** "By chunking a problem, quarter by quarter, moonshots become more doable."
* When you know the stretch goal in advance, you can prepare for it in all its aspects (you can prepare all areas.) (× <a href="#^set-okrs-in-advance">set OKRs ahead of kickoff</a>)
* Massive turnarounds in a short time, are very much possible.
	* "Within three months of launch, Zune had achieved 10 percent market share in its local trade area."
^
# Continuous performance management
* **Transfer an OKR to a different person or team if they can do it more efficiently**; if they have the expertise and bandwidth.
* **Have regular one-on-ones with the employees, for exchanging information and providing support.** (CFRs.) The meeting should aim at exchanging information, understanding, coaching and feedback.
	* The meeting's agenda should be set by the employee.
	* Ones-on-ones are a place to discuss individual OKRs and ask for guidance or support.
* **Regular OKR check-ins allow for extra support and possible escalation** (of the goal). They make possible providing extra support to teams struggling with their OKRs, or OKRs lagging behind ("escalation": putting more attention, effort and emphasis on an OKR at risk, enlisting lateral support).
	* Regular check-ins let you adjust to meet a goal before it's too late.
	* "Selling and buying OKRs": taking turns to ask for help for OKRs at risk, almost competing with the other teams.
		* "Little time is spent on people's greens. Instead, they "sell" their reds. The team votes on the most important at-risk OKRs for the company as a whole, then brainstorms together as long as it takes to get the objectives back on track. In the spirit of cross-departmental solidarity, individuals volunteer to "buy" their colleagues' reds."
* **Elevate KRs to objectives if they require extra attention** (for the next period).
* **Fails require a post-mortem.**
	* For example, failed OKRs require a post-mortem (and a new action plan).
	* "We do not learn from our mistakes, but from reflecting on our mistakes."
^
# Reviewing
* Score objectives and KRs first objectively, then subjectively through self-assessment (was the goal too easy?)
* Reflect on your meta-learnings about goal setting.
* **Play again**: "And then after ten milliseconds of celebration we have to set ourselves another set of highly difficult-to-reach objectives and we have to meet them. **And the reward or having met one of these challenging goals is that you get to play again.**"
^
# People
* **OKRs bring insight into who you need to hire** — which necessary skills for the OKRs you are missing in the company. OKRs also give greater clarity to the future hire as to what their mission will be.
	* **"We hire smart people not to tell them what to do, but so they can tell us what to do."** (Steve Jobs)
* **[Don't lay off; relocate.]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^dont-lay-off-relocate)** if somebody is not managing at their job, find a better fit for them, within the company (human-first). × [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}): [job safety]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^job-safety); [humans are the most flexible resource you have]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^people-are-the-most-flexible-resource). (Internal turnover)
* "Bono, do you know the Senegalese proverb "**If you want to cut a man's hair, it is better if he is in the room**"?"
	* When trying to help people, assist them in helping themselves (x [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}): [hire coaches, not experts]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^hire-coaches-not-experts); [managers should coach, not fix]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^managers-should-coach-not-fix)); "this messiah complex hasn't always turned out so well."
	* When bringing about organizational change, be people-centric: talk to the people, ask them what they want, crowdsource answers.
* **A winning business needs both OKRs and CFRs; the goal-setting and the human.**
	* CFRs: Conversations, Feedback (bi-directional), Recognition.
* "**A manager's first role is the personal one**. It's the relationship with people, the development of mutual confidence, the creation of a community."
	* "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted." (Albert Einstein) (× [Broadcast](https://xaxel.cc/broadcast-music-that-speaks-to-you.html): "We've got what numbers cannot count.")
	* Have regular, deep conversations with people, "not talking about work" (e.g. assisting them in, or learning about, their life goals).
		* "In talking about people's pursuit of personal goals, you end up learning a lot about what moves them forward — or holds them back — in their careers."
			- "What makes you very happy? What saps your energy? How would you describe your dream job?"
			* Know why the people are here, what they want.
				* "What coaching can I provide to help the report fully realize his or her potential?" (× [All About Love]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %}#^love-nurture-growth))
				* "What types of learning experience might benefit this contributor?"
			* Ask people about their (personal) priorities — and it's ok.
	* Work-related questions:
		* "What part of your job most excites you?"
		* "What (if any) aspect of your role would you like to change?"
* Encourage peer-to-peer feedback.
* **Institute recognition.** Create a culture of openly recognizing and giving (specific) shout-outs to people.
	* Make the recognition specific. Share the context around it. Publish in newsletters or company blogs.
- **Conferring a name on a process or project bolsters its existence**, makes it something tangible and that people can reason about.
* **Intelligence is more valuable than knowledge.** By being intelligent, you can learn what you don't know yet. (× [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %}#^intelligence-over-knowledge): Recruiting people with the potential to learn, who can learn the necessary skills on the job.)

# Marketing
* Marketing (e.g. offline ads) are a way to ingrain a certain conceptual model (view) (× [The Design of Everyday Things]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^conceptual-models)) of the product.
	* "In March, we embarked on a "Chrome Fast" marketing campaign."
^
# Quotes and unquotes
* "Entrepreneurs do more than anyone thinks possible, with less than anyone thinks possible. (By contrast with bureaucrats, who do less than anyone thinks possible with more than anyone thinks possible.)"
* **At the end of the day, relationships are what matters the most.**
	* "Finally, I offer my undying gratitude to my wife, Ann, and daughters, Mary and Esther, whose patience, encouragement, and love kept me going through this long and challenging project. **Each and every day, they remind me of what matters the most.**"

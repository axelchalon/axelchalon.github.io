*Here are my notes on Joseph Campbell's* The Hero with a Thousand Faces, *on the hero's journey and myth.*
^
- **I am every single mythical figure.** (× [Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %}))
- **Everyone has their own personal mythology.** Everyone is going through their own hero's journey.
	- **We are not alone in our hero's journey.** Heroes of all time have gone before us – and heroes of our times are going through the same ordeals as we are, as we speak.
	- **Myth is just another forgotten dimension of reality.**
- **We are all copies of one another.** Beneath the illusion of two-ness or multitudinous individualities dwells identity. We are all going through the same adventure.
^
- **Myths are vessels of universal wisdom.**
	- **Fairy tales are local; myths are global.**
	- **Dreams are particular; myths are universal.** (in the solutions they offer).
		- Dream is personalized myth. Myth is depersonalized dream.
- **Dreams and myths share the same symbolic language.** Likewise, dreams stage archetypes. The subconscious thinks symbolically.
- **Dreams are a call to adventure,** point at unresolved tensions and **oppose the security we have created for ourselves**.
	* **Dreams contain the keys to the discovery of one's self.**
* **<mark>The discovery of oneself is both desired and feared.</mark>**
	* **Self-actualization is hampered by fear of death.** We fear for the destruction of our current self (self-preservation instinct at play at the level of a single "self", × [Your Symphony of Selves]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-03-15-your-symphony-of-selves-summary.md %})).
		* **We fear losing ourself and the world we created.** We fear not only the death of our self, but also of the world we have created, and in which it resides.
	* While in fact, **destruction allows for and leads to wonderful reconstruction**. We come out better, less fragmented and more whole. **We die to the past to be re-born to the future.** (shedding skin; after the deluge)
		- **Self-actualization requires a leap of faith**, seeing the ordeal not on its own but juxtaposed with the promise of a better future (× delayed gratification; sea migrants)
* **Memories are a recall to adventure**, reminisce of what is possible, by means of an object-link.
* **By refusing the call to adventure, you become a victim to be saved.**
	- **Life becomes meaningless when not heeding the call to adventure.** (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}), proactivity)
	- **Do not miss the call to adventure, it often happens only once – seize it.** "Dread the passage of Jesus, for he does not return."
	- **Regrets are illuminations come too late**
^
- **Three parts to a hero's journey: separation – initiation – return** (each with their rite of passage) (× Psychedelics)
	- **Rites of passage force a break in one's behaviour patterns** (× retreats, relocations, new chapters); mark the subconscious (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#^symbolic-rituals)).

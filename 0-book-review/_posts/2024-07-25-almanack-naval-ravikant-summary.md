Here are some notes on Eric Jorgensons's ["The Almanack of Naval Ravikant"](https://www.navalmanack.com/ "Sponsored link")
# How to ~~eat~~ be wealthy
- **Learn to build, learn to sell.** "If you can do both, you're unstoppable."
	* "Building" is not limited to tech.
	- Making money — just like learning to build or sell (or peace/happiness) — is a skill and can be learned.
		- Don't be afraid of any book — or any skill to learn (× Scott Young, ["no hard skills, only missing prerequisites"](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2016/04/12/no-hard-subjects/))
		- **Get your foundations right.** Learn basic maths, statistics, microeconomics — what has been true and verified. Focus on getting them right and perfected, rather than advancing into complex topics.
			* Many more complex topics (macroeconomics) are not falsifiable, so we cannot know if they're true.
	- **Create something** — if you cannot code, start a blog, a podcast, shoot videos, write books...
	- Build what society needs (but doesn't know it wants it), **and then scale it**.
	* Doing business is a positive-sum game.
* **Use leverage.** Leverage are resources that multiply the effect of your decisions.
	- **Use leverage to increase your returns** — (automated) labour, money (capital), reputation, building a **product with no cost of replication** (memberships, books, videos, code, etc.)
	- **Permissioned vs permissionless leverage:** capital and labour require people willing to give it to you or work for you; code, automated labour and media are permissionless — use it.
	- Media with no cost of replication tend to coincide with permissionless leverage.
- **Build a reputation for yourself**, by taking risks (ownership) under your own name. "Without accountability, you can't build credibility."
	* And if you fail but gave it your best (and were honest), people will generally forgive you anyway.
	* Reputation tips the balance for two people with the exact same talent, skills.
	* **The more accountability, the more financial reward.** Work your way up. The more risk you take, the more invested you are, the bigger the financial reward.
		* **Work in smaller companies to work your way up more easily.**
	* **Build your brand in preparation for the moment when an opportunity will arise.** Create a reputation for yourself.
- **Be paid for your output, not your input.** What you produce — not how many hours you put in. This lets you focus on results (× [Measure What Matters]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %})) rather than "busy-work"; motivates you to be more efficient. "If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you."
	- Financial freedom can only be achieved through wealth (passive income — equity, investments, ownership in business), not salaried or wage labour. "Having assets that earn while you sleep."
- <a name="^special-knowledge"></a>**Develop your special knowledge** — something born out of a personal obsession, that feels like play, and that cannot be directly taught.
	* <a name="^uniqueness"></a>Specific knowledge comes from your uniqueness, from being you; "each one is the best at being themselves."
		* Everyone has something unique they can offer. Celebrate people's uniqueness, encourage them to be the full expression of themselves (× [All About Love]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %})) "You can make people happy just by uniquely expressing yourself on the Internet."
			* "Most of life is a search of who and what needs you the most." Find your people.
			* "Escape competition through authenticity."
		* **Remember what you were good at as a kid, what you did effortlessly** — or things people around you noticed about you.
	* <a name="^apprenticeships"></a>"When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not schools." (× Mentorship; [Shop Class as Soulcraft]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-10-23-shop-class-as-soulcraft-summary.md %}))
	- **Become the best in the world at what you do — redefine what you do until this is true.**
		- "Productize **yourself**"
	- **Special knowledge can be formed by building a team — where the combination of skills is the special knowledge.**

# Happiness
* "Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want. But peace is what you want most of the time."
- **Train your brain for happiness routines.** You can train (prime) your brain for happiness or gratitude; your brain then becomes better and faster it.
^
# General life 
* "Almost all biases or time-saving heuristics. For important decisions, discard memory and identity, and focus on the problem."
- Favour choices with short-term pain, by default (they are the ones with the long-term benefits)
* <a name="^alumni"></a>Be mindful of who you live with, who you surround yourself with and spend time with, and **which company you work for.** **"The single most important thing about a company is the alumni network you're going to build."**
* You can only make progress and change when you're starting with the truth; when you're being honest with yourself. (× [Psycho-Cybernetics]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-08-15-the-new-psycho-cybernetics-summary.md %}#^acknowledge))
* "The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself." Do not cling to your identity too much.
* "**You can almost always be both honest and positive** — not blunt"
* "I'm very famous for being rude at parties, events, dinners, where the moment I figure out it's a waste of my time, I leave immediately."
	* "Value your time. It is all you have."
^
- Do walking meetings.
- "The best workout for you is one you're excited to do every day."
^
* "You're going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. [...] Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work."

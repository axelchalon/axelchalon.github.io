*Here are my sparse notes on the little-known book* Daring Greatly *by Brené Brown. [Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3QAVkR7OQFj04mRYzwuh4E).*
^
- **Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage.**
- **There is no intimacy without vulnerability.**
- **Use humour to ease vulnerability.** (× [laugh about it (Sex Talks)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^laugh-about-it); lightness)
- **Both men and women are facing their respective struggles**. We're both having a hard time! Let's do this together!
- **Risks are reduced when confronted.** Acknowledging vulnerability makes you less vulnerable. When we acknowledge our vulnerability, we can take preventive measures that make ourselves less vulnerable. (× proactivity)
- **Normalize discomfort**, instead of trying to make things comfortable. **Growth and learning are inherently uncomfortable.** (e.g. hard conversations, etc.) Discomfort is a sign that you're growing. (× [Come As You Are]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-03-emily-nagoski-come-as-you-are-summary.md %}#^discomfort), being okay being in emotionally uncomfortable places — it "stops feeling scary")
	* Cultures (and relational cultures) where discomfort is okay. (× fear at Comfort Zone Crusher challenges — just a feeling; you do it anyway)
- Public speaking: **Address your speech to specific people.** Imagine that you are giving the speech to a few particular people, e.g. specific friends of yours.
^
- **Connection is the energy created between people when they feel seen and valued.** (× [How to Know a Person]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}))
- Trust grows in the small moments — repeated many times.
- **"The betrayal of disengagement"** "Of not caring. Of letting the connection go. Of not being willing to devote time and effort to the relationship. \[...\] When the people we love or with whom we have a deep connection stop carying, stop paying attention, stop investing, and stop fighting for the relationship, trust begins to slip away and hurt starts seeping in."
	- Disengagement is pernicious because of the lack of evidence: you cannot point to a concrete wrong.
^
- **Be in the arena.**
	- "I'm with you. In the arena. And when we fail, we'll fail together, while daring greatly." ("If you go, I go.")
	- By acting bravely, we remind ourselves of our freedom and agency. (× [Pavlina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hFdmt9omBE): "Be a do-er"; [The Courage to Live Consciously](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/the-courage-to-live-consciously/)  ["jump!"](https://thedolectures.com/talks/buckle-up-you-re-in-for-a-whirlwind/))
	- Accept feedback only from people also in the arena.
^
- **Shame vs guilt:** "I am bad" vs "I did something bad".
	- ([All About Love]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %}#^shame-love): "That which is rendered separate or strange through fear (or shame) is made whole through perfect love."; ["Love knows no shame."]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-10-25-all-about-love-bell-hooks-summary.md %}#^shame); The antidote to shame is not sympathy or pity — "Poor you"; it is empathy — "Me too." ([Improvise]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2022-12-15-improvise-max-dickins-summary.md %}#^shame-empathy-sympathy)); "Shame needs secrecy and judgment to thrive" (Brené Brown) ([Sex Talks]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^secrecy-judgment)); Conspiracy of Silence ([Design of Everyday Things]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-07-design-everyday-things-personal-notes.md %}#^conspiracy-of-silence)))
	- **We all have shame.** Shame is human. You are not alone.
	- **Shame is the fear of disconnection.**
	- **Shame is self-protective; gets in the way of vulnerability.** It is difficult to share what we judge in ourselves. "We can't let ourselves be seen if we're terrified by what people might think."
		- **Talk about shame to eliminate it.** "The more you talk about shame, the less we have it." (× [Sex Talks: talk about sex every day]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^talk-sex-every-day); [Sex Talks: normalize sex / talk about it / no big deal]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-06-15-sex-talks-vanessa-marin-summary.md %}#^laugh-about-it))
		- **Shame heals best socially.** Shame heals with empathy. Social hurts need a social balm.
		- **Ask for what you need**, when you feel shame.
- **We judge others in areas where we're vulnerable to shame.**
^
- "What's worth doing even if I fail?" (× fail forward; failure bow; failure résumé; celebrate mistakes; failure as data point)
* **In our faults and limitations, we can also find our strengths.**
- **If you own the story, you get to write the ending.** (× [life stories]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^life-stories), [know your story to write the next chapter]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^next-chapter) (How to Know a Person))
- **Art is what most closely resembles what it is like to be human**. Art lets us present uncategorized feelings and emotions (× [Creative Being]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}); [art the fruit of humans]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-03-22-creative-act-way-being-rick-rubin-summary.md %}#^art-the-fruit-of-humans); [How to Know a Person]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %})).
	- "**It is our nature to be imperfect.** \[…\] To make things that don't sometimes necessarily make sense." (× "Die wahre Herausforderung ist es, ohne Anlass wahnsinnig zu sein"...) 
^
* **People are desperate for feedback — we all want to grow.** It can just be tricky to get it.
- **Show empathy when giving feedback**. "I know it's challenging to ..." / "I had trouble as well when I started..."
- **Receive feedback (anywhere) just before giving it** — helps you put yourself in the receiver's shoes.
	- To give good feedback, regularly receive feedback.
- **Loving self-talk:** Talk to yourself as you would talk lovingly to a friend (× [How to Know a Person]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}); using 2nd or 3rd person).
^
- Management:
	- **Create a culture of not-knowing.** Management shouldn't be seen as "knowing all the answers" — this sends the message to subordinates that they know less. (× [The Toyota Way]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2023-11-30-the-toyota-way-jeffrey-liker-summary.md %})) (× [How to Know a Person]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-06-01-how-to-know-person-david-brooks-summary.md %}#^insure-world-fewer-questions): "an insecure world is a world with fewer questions").
	- **Create the space for others to perform.** (× [delegate the goal, not the method (Clear Thinking)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-04-26-clear-thinking-shane-parrish-summary.md %}#^delegate-goal-not-method) (not micro-managing); [give autonomy (Measure What Matters)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2024-02-18-measure-what-matters-john-doerr-summary.md %}#^give-autonomy))
^
- **Avoiding life through busi-ness.** We want to escape life by remaining busy — blind to what is the most important. We believe if we stay busy, the truth of life won't catch up to us. (× [too busy to question what you're busy with (Essentialism)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^too-busy); [if you don't know what's the most important thing, the most important thing is to figure it out (Essentialism)]({% link 0-book-review/_posts/2025-05-20-essentialism-greg-mc-keown-summary.md %}#^most-important-knowing))
- **Aspirational vs practiced values**. Write down your ideals; then write down how you actually live, feel, behave, think. Bridge the gap. Walk the talk. (× Skin in the Game)
^
- **"Culture is the way we do things around here."**
- Grounded theory (open research with emergent topics)
^
- The empathetic smile, "I've been in this, you're not alone, I'm with you" — e.g. from parents to parents as a child is having a tantrum.
